Hiya! My name is Jim. I spend my days telling computers what to do. When I'm not doing that, I like to read voraciously and  write occasionally.

If you'd like to connect with me professionally, [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmcgaw).

If you'd like to see what kind of code I'm kicking out these days, view my Github:
{% include icon-github.html username="jimmcgaw" %}

If you'd like to know more about my work experience, <a href="http://www.jimmcgaw.com/" target="_blank">view my résumé</a>.
