title: Of Course It's Possible
---

My girlfriend shared an interesting story with me about the lead programmer of the company she works for. People will go to him with the question: "Is it possible to do [insert feature here]." <br /><br />His response is always the same: "Anything is possible. But how much are you willing to pay for it?"<br /><br />When people say things aren't possible, usually what they mean is: <em>given the resources available to me and the timeline, it's not possible.</em>. Or: <em>it's not worth the trade-off</em>.<br /><br />That programmer's honest response belies an intensely creative imagination. He understands that we live in a world where available time and money are most often the constraints. Most of the time, what's actually <em>possible</em> is not a constraint.
