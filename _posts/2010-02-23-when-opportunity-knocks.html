title: When Opportunity Knocks
---

We're told to listen to make sure we don't miss it when opportunity knocks on our door. The implication, then, is that we should sit idly by and wait for opportunity to come to us. <br /><br />That's not entirely a bad thing, because some days, we just need to relax and passively dream. I've had plenty of Sundays where I sat around, wishing the opportunity to be a part of something would present itself to me, and (big reveal!) it didn't, and I just ended up going to sleep that evening, having gotten nowhere.<br /><br />There are lots of people sitting around, waiting for opportunity to knock on their doors. This sounds like an opportunity in and of itself. Given the Internet's capacity to help you organize and mobilize large groups, here's the big question: where would you lead all of those people if you asked them to follow you, and a bunch of them said yes?<br /><br />Given the right opportunity, there are lots of people ready to follow you. Ready to lead? Figure out where you want to go, and then get out and go knocking.
