There are certain types of debates in which I don't get involved. Generally, this is when a line is drawn and two opposing sides start lobbing stones at one another. <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/">This is a pretty good summary</a> of why I keep my distance:<div><br /></div><div>"Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm...When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger."</div><div><br /></div><div>No, this doesn't surprise me, because everyone (including myself) is susceptible to this kind of behavior. These days, I'm much less inclined to treat a person who's expressing a dissenting opinion to me as a personal attack.</div>
