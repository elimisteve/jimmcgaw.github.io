title: Your Enemy's iTunes Library
---

Would you take a music recommendation from someone that you hated? Would you consider listening to the iTunes playlist of someone you completely despised? Would you watch a movie if a personal enemy of yours told you it was good? Why or why not?<br /><br />Most of us would be inclined not only to <em>not</em> listen to the music of our enemies, but to strictly <em>avoid</em> listening to it at all costs. Even if we end up in a situation where we're forced to hear the songs, our brains will work hard to make sure that, no matter what, we don't end up <em>liking</em> them. And we'll make sure of it with all our might.<br /><br />Why is that? There are people that I don't like, and there are almost certainly people that despise me. But what does that have to do with the type of media we chose to consume? Nothing, really. I'm a person who is looking for interesting music...so is each of the people that I dislike.<br /><br />Even people that I like, but who I know to have "poor" taste in music, I'll go to great efforts to avoid admitting that I share their taste in music. These little cognitive biases play a huge role in determining what art we deem acceptable. This is silly. Nothing should preclude me from liking a song just because it happens to be a favorite of a person whose company I cannot stand.<br /><br />And yet, it matters...at least in my head.
