title: The Labor
---

"Everyone is already producing anything that anybody could possibly want." This mentality kills the entrepreneur in all of us.<br /><br />"Everyone already has everything they need, or want and can afford." This mentality kills the salesman in all of us.<br /><br />"I'm not confident that I'm right, so I have no place nudging people in any particular direction." This kills the leader in all of us.<br /><br />Out of necessity, we are, at the core of nature, each and every one of these things. And we're each of these mentalities in school because they make it easy to be happy just being "labor".
