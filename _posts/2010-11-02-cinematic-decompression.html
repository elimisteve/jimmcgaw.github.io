I'm not a big fan of going to the movies. This is a pretty common trend among young people...the experience of going to the theater and paying $10 to see a film ($13 if you have to see it in the obligatory 3-D) is not really worth it. Having to sit for two hours in an uncomfortable seat, possibly surrounded by loud people, and devoting all of your attention, undivided, to a movie that might end up being a waste of money.<br /><br />People in my generation are more likely to be doing exactly what I'm doing: sitting at home with the television on, Netflix streaming into the box, with a laptop perched on my legs. I'm multitasking. Even with the TV on, I'm usually toying around on Facebook, writing music, or doing something else at the same time.<br /><br />And yet, as painful as immersing yourself into a film experience can be (when the movie is really, really terrible), there's something unique about the feeling of emerging from it. I suspect most people see movies in theaters close to home; it's odd to walk out of a dark theater and step back into the real world. The process of adjusting from the fantasy to reality, where immersion is total, gives us new perspective on the world around us. I always feel like my brain is being rewired and tweaked in subtle ways as I struggle to reconcile the movie experience with my own life. I almost <em>never</em> get that from watching a DVD at home.<br /><br />Worth $10? That I'm not sure of. Maybe I just need to turn down the lights and turn off the laptop and the DVD will have the same effect.
