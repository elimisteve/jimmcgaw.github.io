title: Start Right Now
---

Whatever you aspire to do with your life, get started right now. This very moment. You might be at work, so maybe you can't produce anything, but start thinking about it. Starting brainstorming the ideas in your head; write them down if you can.<br /><br />Start that blog, post a post that you think will inspire people, share a business idea with a friend, project a monthly budget for the next year.<br /><br />There's nothing separating you from those who get things done except for the mere act of doing. A lack of money, a lack of experience, or a lack of a perfect idea is not any kind of excuse to put things off. <br /><br />Go get started.
