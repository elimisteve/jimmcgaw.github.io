title: What You Don't Know
---

In the software world, lots of computer programmers load up their resumes with all the relevant acronyms, buzz words, and technologies that anyone might need. Lots of job posters are no better; since human resources doesn't understand the language they're attempting to speak, they err on the side of listing all of the buzz words, too. It's a wonder the right person ever gets hired for the right job, and that anything ever gets done.<br /><br />If I were a hiring manager in charge of recruiting people, I'd be very interested in reading a resume that contained an "anti-skill set" section. Sure, tell me what you're good at and what you excel at doing...but while you're at it, tell me what you're not good at or where your weaknesses lie. Tell me what you don't know.<br /><br />No one is perfect, no one knows everything, and you're no exception. I just want you to demonstrate that you're cognizant of it.
