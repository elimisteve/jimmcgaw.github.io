title: When I Got Here
---

When daylight saving time was first observed in 1918, there was an awful lot of controversy about the idea. People and pundits came out of the woodwork to proclaim that the implementation of an hour shift in our clocks twice a year would have serious moral, religious, political, or pseudo-scientific consequences, and that it would leave future generations spiritually bankrupt in some profound way. ("Won't someone please think of the children?")<br /><br />I was born in 1982, so people had been observing daylight saving time for well over 60 years by that time. As they say: it was like that when I got here. By the time I learned DST was supposed to ruin our civilization, it had already become part of my lifestyle.<br /><br />Too often, people forget that their children won't be exactly like them, and they'll live in a different world. We all want to leave behind a better world for our children, but people sometimes forget about the resilience factor in young people. They forget just how easily new generations adapt to new things. What looks like drastic change to you will just be the reality of tomorrow's generation. And chances are good they'll deal with it just <em>fine</em>.
