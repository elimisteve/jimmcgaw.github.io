title: What If You're Wrong?
---

We generally interpret that question as an assault on our egos. If someone asks us to consider even the possibility that we're wrong, either about an opinion or a proposed course of action, we get very defensive. <br /><br />It's very difficult to tell or suggest to another person that they're wrong. Chances are, you won't change their mind. If anything, you may end up having the opposite effect: the more defensive a person is acting, the less likely they are to reconsider, or even think about, exactly what it is they're defending.<br /><br />I think considering the possibility that you might be wrong can often serve as the ultimate escape route. We get to a point where we're clinging to what we (think we) know and have trouble letting go. But being wrong can be a relief...so long as you ask it of yourself before someone else does. Then, it's an argument.<br /><br />It's the question I (try to) never stop asking myself.
