title: Noodles

Starting is pretty easy.<br /><br />I have lots of ideas for projects to do. Over the past few years, I've bought a lot of domain names for sites I didn't end up building, put in time writing pages of books that I'll probably never finish, and bought materials for art projects that I'll never complete. Ideate, start, but it doesn't pan out.<br /><br />Of course, this is my fault, but I'm okay with it. Enough projects get seen through to completion to make it worthwhile, and more often than not, I get far enough that I learn several things before the project is done. <br /><br />Upfront, I usually can't guess which things I'll finish and which I'll abandon halfway into the journey. I just start. It's like throwing a bunch of wet noodles against the wall and seeing which ones stick. The key: they're my noodles, and it's my wall.<br /><br />Sometimes, you just have start and see if it sticks. You might think something feels right, but usually you don't know for sure before you start.<br /><br />Some things are too important to be left to the whims of my attention span, but aside from those, I'm still experimenting to see what it is I'm really passionate about. My guess is it's the same for you.
