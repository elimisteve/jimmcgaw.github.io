title: Make the Invisible Visible

I remember reading once that for every four minutes that a person spends in the shower, on average, one more ton of carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and so the time we spend in the shower in the mornings contributes to the greenhouse effect.<br /><br />This isn't something that people think about at seven in the morning before they've had their morning coffee. So, I say we either invent a coffee pot that sticks to tiles with suction cups and brews coffee in the shower...<br /><br />...or (better idea) invent a contraption that displays to people just how many tons of CO<sub>2</sub> they're releasing into the atmosphere. This could be a simple dial that just senses when the shower goes on, and a little digital readout that increments as the hot water flows.<br /><br />That would put the issue on people's minds, right when and where it matters.
