title: Ranking Chatter
---

In conversation there are a few different kinds of things people can talk about. Ranking them from least useful (and most annoying) to more constructive:<br /><br />1. Gossip about celebrities.<br />2. Gossip about other people.<br />3. Expounding on bad things from the past.<br />4. Expounding on bad things in the present.<br />5. Dwelling on anxiety about the future.<br />6. Discussing the past as it applies to the present.<br />7. Discussing the past as it applies to the future.<br />8. Discussing the present as it applies to the future.<br />9. Discussing what great things the future could hold.<br /><br />Not all conversation is created equal. And all conversation is trumped by any action that carries you forward along the lines of #9.
