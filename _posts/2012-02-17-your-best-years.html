title: Your Best Years
---

Your best years are ahead of you.<br /><br />I may not know you, or have a clue how old you are, but I know I'm right. Yesterday, the day before, and the expanse of days that stretch into the past belong to the ages. Mourn them if you must, but they are history's property now.<br /><br />But today? And tomorrow? Those belong to you.
