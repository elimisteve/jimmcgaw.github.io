title: Conclusion Du Jour
---

There are a few very simple lessons that I hope people take away after they read they stuff I've been writing on here, and one of them is: don't take your own ideas that seriously.<br /><br />Economists call it the endowment effect, which basically says that we tend to place a higher value on things once they're in our possession. We're loss averse, and while that's a great survival tactic, it can become a hindrance if it precludes you from gaining new ideas.<br /><br />And often, you have to lose one of your ideas in order to gain a new one.<br /><br />Sometimes, when I'm talking to people about something, I'll offer to them my "conclusion du jour"...that is, the conclusion I've reached and am toying with at that particular moment. It's not that I change my mind about every topic each and every day, but the phrase <em>du jour</em> refers to something that isn't necessarily going to stick around.<br /><br />The other great thing about <em>du jour</em> items in restaurants is that they're generally not a part of the regular menu. The chef in the kitchen gets to experiment with a new recipe without any long-term commitment. He's free to stumble around, put a little too much of this or that into the pot, and he doesn't have to be consistent from night-to-night. Consistency has its merits, but it can make a person weary, too.
