title: Walking a Mile
---

Whenever you go to a shoe store and try on new pairs of shoes, there's one thing that people always do: try them on and walk around to see if they like how they feel. By the same token, there is always one thing missing from every shoe store that I've ever been do: a designated walking area. <br/><br/>The fitting room for a pair of shoes is not a closed and private area, like when people are trying on pants or tops. What they need is a small patch of ground that covers most terrains on which you plan to walk. Concrete. A patch of grass. An inclined surface. <br/><br/>I was with my girlfriend at a store earlier today called "Running Fit" that sold running accessories, one of which was shoes. Everyone in the place was trying on shoes and walking around the store amongst the racks of other, largely untouched merchandise to see how they liked the shoes. The whole time I was asking myself: Why isn't there a place to run?<br/><br/>If you're a shoe store selling high heels and you really want to be ostentatious, put in a runway. An elevated platform that women can stroll down, to make them feel glamorous. <br/><br/>The wisdom of Atticus Finch in <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> doesn't just apply to a man. You really don't know a pair of shoes until you put on those shoes and walk a mile in them.
