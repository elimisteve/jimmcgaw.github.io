title: Where's the Hard Part?
---

There's always something. If there isn't, you should do something else.<br /><br />I had a friend once try to convince me that we should set up an online store selling drop-shipped goods. In theory, the website itself would do little more than put content out to Google, capture orders, and pass them on to the drop shipper, who would fulfill them and handle any customer service issues.<br /><br />I thought it was a terrible idea, just because it was all too easy...almost Faustian easy. Simple reason: last time I checked, customers pay for value added. And a site like the one I described isn't adding a whole lot of value.<br /><br />No, customer service isn't easy. If you open a store or restaurant, you're going to deal with people who are having a bad day and who, for their own selfish reasons, are going to take it out on you.<br /><br />I wish I made the rules, because it would be great to give the devil his due and make life easy. Until then, a cardinal guideline: if it's all easy, it's probably not worth doing.
