title: People Are Their Perceptions
---

There's a sight called Squidoo that was founded by marketing guru Seth Godin. After you sign up, you get to create a page that is your own "lens", with content from all corners of the internet that interests you. People can find your lens, you can view the lens' of others, and there is a "most popular lenses" type feature on the home page. I haven't found the site very useful, but there are lots of people sharing recipes and petlovers sharing stories about their cats on there.<br/><br/>The one thing that I do find interesting is the use of the term "lens" to describe your little page. It intrigues me because I've always thought of people as lenses in and of themselves. It defines who we are as people. When you meet a new person for the first time, or are hanging out with a friend, they are really offering you a window into their own perception of reality, through their opinions. The point their lens at something, choose the filter that best suits them, and then let you gaze into it.<br/><br/>Our own brains are pretty good at this, too. The little voice chattering incessantly between your own ears has its own way of filtering out information, picking and choosing what it accepts into consideration. It influences our own reflections of the world around us. Someone could probably write a pretty terrible poem stretching this "perception as light" simile way too far.
