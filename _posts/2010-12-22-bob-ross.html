One of the most popular art shows ever to air on television wasn't even really about art.<br /><br />I've watched "The Joy of Painting" dozens or even hundreds of times since I first discovered him in sixth grade. And yet, I haven't picked up a paint brush since I did those paint-by-number watercolor books when I was in elementary school. I bet a lot of his viewers are like me, and have never even tried painting, but they know what a fan brush is and they go looking for Van Dyke brown when they're in an art supply store.<br /><br />Bob Ross himself said that part of what he set out to do with his program was to give people a place of tranquility and inner peace. He offered a break from the stress of their daily lives. I know a few people who are trying to give this to people by telling them to meditate, to try Buddhism, to go to Yoga classes, and so on. But most people, as stressed as they are, aren't necessarily looking for a relaxation solution or a major lifestyle change.<br /><br />You can get it from Bob, though, who brilliantly disguised this gift as a television show about painting. And you won't realize what he's given you until after it's too late.
