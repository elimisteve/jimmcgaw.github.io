I've come across more than one start-up website in the last few months that is missing a link from the bottom of every page: "Careers". It should always be nestled down there, right along with "Contact Us" and "Privacy Policy". <br /><br />It doesn't matter if you aren't even hiring...list the active departments you have and a brief overview of what each one does. Even a link to a page where you say that you <em>aren't</em> hiring, but include an email link that lets people submit a resume to human resources if they have a general interest in working for the company.<br /><br />All companies, especially small ones, should constantly be scouting for talented people. And really, if you're hiring people, you don't look like you're growing, and if that's the case, why should I do business with you?
