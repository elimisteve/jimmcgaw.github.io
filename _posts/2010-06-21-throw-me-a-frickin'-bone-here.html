title: Throw Me a Frickin' Bone Here
---

There's a local band in my town that plays Peruvian jazz. In truth Peruvian style, the guitar player always plays the pan flute instead of a harmonica. He's accompanied by a percussionist on conga drums and a saxophonist. They are an excellent group, and if they're playing in town, I'll go watch them perform when I've got a free evening. <br /><br />At their shows, there's always a video camera set up on a tripod, recording them. This would lead you to believe that amateur videos would inevitably crop up somewhere on social media. On their Facebook page, someone asked them why they don't post videos of their live performances and why they don't make any of their music available online. The guitar player replied, "We're putting together a CD and we hope to be selling it at our shows soon."<br /><br />In short, and to paraphrase Dr. Evil: where's the bone? If I want to tell someone about their music, the only thing I can do is mention a vague "Uh, they play in town, and they've got a Facebook page with some pictures on it, but no music." There's nothing I can spread. There's no way for me to share their essence.<br /><br />It's his music, his art, his passion, so he's got the final say, but I wonder about whether that's the correct approach to things. If I were a musician, and I produced a CD, and someone wanted to listen to the music, I would gladly <em>give</em> them a CD. Better yet, I'd give them MP3s and encourage them to pass them along to anyone interested in them. <br /><br />It's not much about making a sale as it is creating a fan. Throw people a frickin' bone, and make it easy for them to throw it to their friends.
