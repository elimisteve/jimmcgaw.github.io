title: Markets Value Scarcity
---

That goes for all markets. The stock market, the labor market, the job market, and the market for anything else you can think of. That means it's never going to be as easy as you think.<br /><br />There's lot of books about how to find a job, how to invest in stocks and make money, how to get a book published, and so on. All of this advice might be very prudent, but you can never expect to open up a book, follow the instructions, and achieve the goal you wanted. This is because if it's easy, lots of people do it, and if everyone's doing it, it isn't unique. <br /><br />Even if it takes effort, a lot of people might still do it, and the market will quickly adjust itself so that it no longer rewards what those people are doing.<br /><br />If you create a resume based on advice from a book on resume writing, don't be shocked when you don't hear back from that employer. And I wouldn't expect the secrets of the stock market to exist between the covers of that "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" book series, either. Anyone can follow instructions. Most people happily do just that. Almost always, it doesn't get them the result that they wanted.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde once wrote: "Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught." But an important corollary to that maxim is that anything worth knowing can be learned.
