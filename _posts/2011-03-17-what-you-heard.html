title: What You Heard
---

We don't always remember everything exactly as we heard it.<br /><br />News articles, Facebook statuses, and Tweets all flow in, as an endless digital river of content. There's value in a lot of it, but most things don't stick over the long term. <br /><br />A friends posts that he just saw a really terrible movie that he hated. "Don't see [Film X]." I read it, it sinks  and disappears into the gray matter between my ears.<br /><br />Six months later, and someone asks me if we should rent Film X. And when I try to dredge up what I heard, I cannot recall any kind of positive or negative association. The only thing I can remember is that I've heard of it before.<br /><br />It isn't just me; it's people in general. In a world where we're barraged with information, we often lose the significance of each piece of data that enters our brains. <br /><br />This doesn't quite equate to the whole "all publicity is good publicity" maxim, because I firmly believe that people are inclined to remember extremes. But that does mean that, given the choice to mention something that I really hated and something I really liked, I'll mention the latter. I want the good stuff to stick.
