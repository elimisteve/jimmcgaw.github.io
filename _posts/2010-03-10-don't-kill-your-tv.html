title: Don't Kill Your TV
---

"Kill your TV" is a slogan you see on bumper stickers and spray-painted on sidewalks. It's intended to influence people and get them to do something other than passively consume entertainment and mass media, blah blah. It's more than a little extreme, and it's off-putting. <br /><br />You don't have to kill your TV. I don't think you even have to get off the couch. Just put a project in front of you that you can work on while you watch TV. Turn your coffee table into a workstation. Put up an easel and see what you can paint while "American Idol" is on. Hammer out prose or poetry on your laptop. There's no reason you have to upend your whole lifestyle in order to start creating things.<br /><br />Self-expression is the new leisure.
