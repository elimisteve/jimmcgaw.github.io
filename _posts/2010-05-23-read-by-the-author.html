title: Read By The Author
---

I bought a couple of Audiobooks recently for the long car drive back from Tucson. The first one I bought was a book called <em>Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</em> by Tom Vanderbilt, which is a fascinating book written by a computer scientist about human psychology on the road. (It is, incidentally, the perfect book to listen to in the car while you're driving.) The other book was Malcolm Gladwell's <em>What the Dog Saw</em>. <br /><br />Now, Malcolm Gladwell doesn't have the best voice on the planet, but it's distinctive and generally very pleasant, and I was happy to see that he reads the entire book himself in the recording. On the other hand, the <em>Traffic</em> was not read by its author, but instead by a voice actor.<br /><br />I'm confused by this. If you're an author looking to brand yourself, to make people interested in hiring you for speaking engagements (Malcolm does a lot of those), why wouldn't you want your audience to hear you read your own words yourself? Call it personal branding. As an author, I would think you'd want to build a relationship with your readers, and what better way to do that than to talk directly to them?<br /><br />P.S. The <em>Traffic</em> audiobook is also abridged, while <em>What the Dog Saw</em> is read in its entirety. It also confuses me why they abridge audiobooks. They're much expensive than they should be anyway, and what message are they sending by selling a version with a bunch of material cut out? Doesn't that send the message that the unabridged version was superfluous in the first place?
