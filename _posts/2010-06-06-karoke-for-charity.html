title: Karoke for Charity
---

A suggestion for the very small charities working to do fundraising in your local communities: borrow a Karoke machine from a friend and hit the bars on Friday and Saturday nights. Then, invite people to Karoke by paying a small fee (which will go to your charity) for privilege of singing.<br /><br />Better yet, have people who want to sing set prices for how much it will cost to get them up on stage to sing a song of their choice, then rally everyone else in the bar to throw money into the pot to encourage them to do it. It might take thiry bucks to get George up on stage to butcher Erasure's "A Little Respect". See if you can get five bucks out of six people there to make it happen. Remind them it's all for charity. (And then, when George does it, buy him a beer for being a good sport.)<br /><br />I have no idea if anyone's ever done this, but if done correctly, with the right crowd of people, it could be lucrative. It's not the correct approach for the Red Cross, but for smaller organizations, it would be a welcome break from stuffy meetings in someone's basement.
