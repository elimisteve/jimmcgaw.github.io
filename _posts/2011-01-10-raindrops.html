Do you know what a falling raindrop looks like? A lot of people think it looks like a sphere with a pointed top, but in reality, droplets of water only look like that when they're dangling off of something or sliding down a vertical surface. In mid-air, drops of water become completely spherical. That doesn't make sense to us, because it's not the way we see things.<br /><br />There's a small problem with the moment we're stuck in at any given point in time: we have a lot of trouble seeing it for what it is. It's difficult for us to assess the present because, at any given time, we tend to be caught up in dealing with what's at hand.<br /><br />And yet, if we can't clearly see where we are now, we tend to have a difficult time seeing exactly where we're headed.
