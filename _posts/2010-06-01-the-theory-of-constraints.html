title: The Theory of Constraints
---

In the world of business, the theory of constraints basically says that in any system, there is a small handful of bottlenecks that are keeping the system from reaching maximum efficiency. This applies to any business with a complicated manufacturing environment; according to the theory, there's bound to be something that's keep the output from getting higher. If you isolate and fix that problem, then you're golden.<br /><br />This applies at the individual level, but in a different way. We often need to <em>create</em> constraints for ourselves, not remove them. <br /><br />One example: whenever my girlfriend and I are on our way out to the coffee shop to read for an evening, I'll scan the dozens of unread books sitting on my shelves for one I should take with me to read. There's too many to choose from, so I'll often grab a backpack, pick five books that I might be interested in reading, and take them all with me. Later, when I get to the coffee shop, I still have trouble choosing from among the books which one I want to read. There's opportunity cost with each book: if I read one, then I can't read the other four.<br /><br />It's silly, but it's how we're wired. We're paralyzed by too many choices, whatever the situation. What does that mean for us in a world where you have so many different options for how you spend your time, so many ways you can express yourself and create art, how do you avoid getting overwhelmed? Constrain yourself. You could blog, or you could write that screenplay you've been thinking about, or you could write that fundraising letter, but which one do you pick? <br /><br />Ultimately, how you choose to constrain yourself, how you limit your choices in order to make the decision of what you should do today easier, is entirely up to you. Disconnect the Internet if you have to, so you won't be tempted to check your email. Turn off the TV and choose one book of the many to read. Eliminate options, focus your efforts, and follow through on the plan you choose.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't do nothing.
