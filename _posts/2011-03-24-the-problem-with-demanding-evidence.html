title: The Problem with Demanding Evidence
---

<a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2011/03/03/amanda-hocking/">Amanda Hocking</a> has been getting a lot of ink lately. She's a self-published author of fiction on the Kindle. She sells her little e-books for $1, $2, or $3 each. The latest news is that she's making millions of dollars without having ever gone through a traditional publisher.<br /><br />If you were looking for evidence that this is even possible to do, there it is. <br /><br />I've been telling everyone I know, with all my fervor, that if you're a writer, there's money in the Kindle. Most people shrug complacently; they don't disagree with me, but they're waiting it out. They want some assurance that it will work for them before they commit any time to things.<br /><br />That's usually a good strategy because it conserves energy, but it shouldn't be the rule for everything. Most people demand evidence, and while they're waiting for it, the people with the passion to make things happen aren't waiting for evidence, they're executing. And they're the ones that win because they'll get there first.<br /><br />The Kindle as a publishing platform is relatively new. It's possible that selling books through it was a bad idea two years ago. It's possible that it will be a bad idea two years from now, or whenever the market is saturated. But right now, <em>now</em>, there's possibilities. Not guarantees, but the possibilities are big ones if you figure out how to do it right.<br /><br />If you have a book, however short, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1440488886/">format it for the Kindle</a> and put it out there.<br /><br />Go.
