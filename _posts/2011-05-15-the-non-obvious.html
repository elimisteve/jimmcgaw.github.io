title: The Non-Obvious
---

One of the factors considered in whether or not an invention or an idea is patentable is the concept of <em>non-obviousness</em>. That is, could someone in your profession have conceived of the same idea or been able to solve the problem without a lot of thought?<br /><br />I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not terribly interested in dwelling on legal matters, but I like the implications that the term "non-obvious" belies. I think that good ideas are always out in the open, but no one's found them because no one's gone looking for them.<br /><br />Some obvious ideas:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A mobile app for passengers for commercial airline flight tracking.</li><br /><li>A retail store that sells sports apparel for big-league teams.</li><br /><li>A coffee or cupcake shop.</li><br /><li>A New Age store that holds Yoga classes in the evenings.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Some (maybe) not-so-obvious ideas (ignoring any implications for patent-ability):<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A device that helps senior citizens manage their daily medications.</li><br /><li>A [something]-gram that could be sent to men. (Men don't like getting flowers delivered at work. Make it something different.)</li><br /><li>A coffee or cupcake shop which, by design, accommodates people with all major allergies or other dietary restrictions.</li><br /><li>Software for a golf course that helps manage caddies. Or that matches up a golfer's schedule with that of his/her favorite caddy.</li><br /><li>A point-of-sale system for restaurants, which includes portable devices that let each server send orders to the kitchen, then charge a credit card and capture an on-screen signature right at the table.</li><br /></ul>
