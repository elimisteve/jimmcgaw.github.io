title: They're All Going to Laugh At You
---

Of course, if you try something, and you fail, then everyone is going to notice, everyone is going to ridicule you, and nobody will forget it as long as you live.<br /><br />But that's not really true.<br /><br />There are some spectacular failures that get a lot of press, like New Coke. But for the overwhelming majority of things, failure is an event that goes unnoticed, and is quickly forgotten.<br /><br />The day Apple announced the iPad, it was derided endlessly by nerds, and the speculation was that it would be a miserable failure. Let's imagine they had been right...Apple would have moved on, and the name "iPad" would be all but forgotten.<br /><br />Remember when companies tried to create tablet PCs back in the 1990's and they failed to make them take off? Right, exactly...almost no one remembers that.<br /><br />Even getting away from lofty examples using Apple, it took me years--<em>years</em>--to learn that if you opened your mouth in a social situation and nobody responds to what you say, it's not the end of the work. When someone else says something, and no one says anything, it's not a big deal. The comment just passes, unnoticed. It just feels different when it us.<br /><br />People won't laugh at you for trying. They'll do what they usually do: ignore you. You should take comfort in that, because it's actually liberating. When no one's looking, you can take a lot of risks.<br /><br />The hard part is figuring what kinds of risks you're going to spend your time taking.
