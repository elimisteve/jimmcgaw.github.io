title: The Simple Rule of Delegation
---

It's wrong to assume that business management principles can be applied to the problems of public education. <br /><br />First of all, a lot of business management philosophy is flawed; it doesn't work out in the business world. A lot of common sense in the business world that people take for granted is broken, but they don't know it because, hey, they're taking it for granted. And the reason why you'd take broken rules from one domain to try and fix another is idiotic.<br /><br />Here's one management principle I strongly agree with: don't delegate something to me if you don't trust me to do a good job of it. If you don't like what I produce or what I have to say, please do it yourself. I'm interested in continually learning to improve myself, so I will pay attention to my own mistakes, but I won't take exact directives.<br /><br />By the same token, if you know exactly how you want your kids to be taught, then the solution is simple: <em>homeschool them</em>. If you choose not to do this, and instead send them off to public school, don't be overly critical of any of your child's teacher's methods. <br /><br />Go to parent-teacher night, keep your mouth shut, and <em>listen</em>. Offer questions or suggestions where you feel it's necessary, but respect the boundaries of the parent-teacher relationship.<br /><br />If you're trusting your kids to the teachers of the public education system, let them do their jobs. If you're going to delegate, then you don't get to issue orders.
