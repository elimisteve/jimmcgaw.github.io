title: Plunge Instead of Trot
---

The hour of New Year's resolutions is almost upon us. There's a trend that happens every year: at the beginning of January, gym memberships and attendance spike up. By February first, the number of people at the gym has fallen back to its normal count.<br /><br />We just can't keep it up for very long. We resolve to do things, but don't follow through for very long. This belies a simple truth: people want to create, but they don't want to maintain. <br /><br />Since New Year's lights a fire under our butts, maybe we shouldn't be trying to alter our behavior in the long term. Instead, why not use the New Year's initiative to do something crazy? Something you've always wanted to do, but couldn't muster up the nerve. Trying speaking in public. Enter a negotiation with your manager at work and see if you can get the upper hand. Break the ice with one of your fears.<br /><br />Maybe just doing it, even once, will make the second and third times easier. And that simple act might change the rest of your year, instead of just the first month.
