title: '"It''s Not Worth It"'
---

This is the platitude that's best known for breaking up bar fights.<br /><br />The other day I was walking down the street and witnessed a car approach an intersection to turn right a little too hastily. In the process, they nearly hit a pedestrian crossing the street. Fortunately, they managed to stop in time without anyone getting hurt.<br /><br />Five years ago, I think this would have made me angry. It's a situation that I wasn't involved with, nothing bad happened (although it could have). And even if something bad had happened, my getting angry wouldn't have helped the situation any. If I chose to intervene, it likely wouldn't affect the driver's future behavior and it certainly wouldn't get the paramedics on their way to help.<br /><br />This time, I didn't get angry. Not worth it.<br /><br />This phrase is a question that should become a personal mantra: "Is it worth it?" We should get comfortable asking it, and asking it often, before we do anything.<br /><br />You've only got so many hours in the day and so many days in each week. How many do you want to spend watching television? I don't mean to pick on television, but: after how many hours does television stop being "worth it"? <br /><br />What is your time worth to you?
