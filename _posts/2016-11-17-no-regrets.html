title: No Regrets
---

It dawned on me over the course of this past week that I really don't have any regrets. I've examined a lot of the important decisions I've made in my life, and I know that in each circumstance, I've made the right choice. At least, I'm sure they're the choices I would make again if I had it all to do over again.

Somehow, this is worse. It would be nice to have a regret or two. Something I could point to and say, "If only I had done <i>this</i> instead, maybe my life might have ended up different than it is now." The fact that my decisions have been in harmony with who I am makes where I've ended up seem all but inevitable.
