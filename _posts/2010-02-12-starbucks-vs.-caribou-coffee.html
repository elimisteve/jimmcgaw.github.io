title: Starbucks vs. Caribou Coffee
---

There's a split in the members of my girlfriend's extended family. It's about the choice of coffee: some of them prefer Starbucks, and some of them prefer Caribou. The debate comes up from time to time. Each side believes, stubbornly, that their choice of coffee is superior to the other. I think it's a silly argument, since we have both, so which one is actually "better" doesn't seem to make much of a difference.<br /><br />Okay, quick thought experiment: imagine I show up at the family Christmas, in that house packed full of 20-30 people, with two new bags of coffee, one from Starbucks and Caribou. Let's say I grind the beans, brew one pot of each, and then have everyone taste the Starbucks one, then the Caribou one, and tell me which one they liked better. What do you think is going to happen? Which one do you think each person will prefer?<br /><br />Now imagine that I do the same thing, but I switch them. When I tell them they're drinking Caribou, it's the Starbucks blend, and vice versa. Now what do you think is going to happen? Which one do you think people are going to like? Their favorite kind or the one tastes better?<br /><br />Good brands create cognitive biases in our brains. It doesn't matter that people's choices aren't scientific, or would hold up in any kind of double-blind taste test. It tastes good not necessarily because of what's in the cup, but because we're busy esteeming ourselves for what's on the outside of the cup.<br /><br />In slightly unrelated news, here's an old, hilarious SNL skit with Chris Farley in which he's served Instant Coffee instead of regular coffee in one of those old "hidden camera" gags (I hope it's still up when you read this):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dula.tv/watch.php?file=chris-farley-coffee-switch.flv">Chris Farley Coffee Switch</a>
