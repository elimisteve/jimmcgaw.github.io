Saw a great <a href="http://vimeo.com/14950095">video</a> earlier this week in which Seth Godin shares an old Zig Ziglar story about a school that had problems with student graffiti. In an effort to fight the vandalism, the principal of the school started finding students who had done something good. Then, he sent a note home with the student to their parents reading, "Your son or daughter was caught doing something good in school." The parents had to read it, sign it, and send it back with their student the next day. According to the story, within a few month's time, the graffiti had all but disappeared.<br /><br />Stop finding the darkness and trying to stamp it out. Instead, find the bright spots and figure out how to make more of them.
