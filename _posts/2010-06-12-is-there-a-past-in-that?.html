title: Is There A Past In That?
---

Before we embark on new ventures or commit to new fields too heavily, we ask: "Is there a future in that?" Naturally, you want to make sure what you're doing is worth the time and effort that you're going to be putting into it.<br /><br />A different question you should ask yourself might be: "Is there a past in that?" More specifically, is any of <em>your</em> past in the project? Ask yourself if you're doing this for any of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. You're personally vested in the idea. (even though its shelf life may have expired)<br />2. Out of habit<br />3. You're doing it strictly to compete with someone else<br />4. You're on a revenge kick to get even with someone<br /><br />If you are, it might be time to stop and start over. There's lot of good reasons to follow through on stuff. But if what you're doing is too much mired into who you were five years ago or an idea you had when you were that person, it might be wise to let go of it.
