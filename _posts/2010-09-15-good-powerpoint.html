title: Good Powerpoint
---

I met a woman from Denmark earlier this week who's currently working in the United States as a consultant to businesses. According to her, she helps people prepare Powerpoint presentations. In her words, she tries to make them "more visually striking and not just full of lots and lots of text". Who knew you could do that for a living? And I was glad to hear it, because anyone who's had the misfortune of spending lots of time in the business world knows how painful it is when a speaker throws up Powerpoint slides and just <em>reads</em> from them the whole time. If you can do that and get your point across, why didn't you just send me an email? Sheesh.<br /><br />Usually, when I meet a police officer, firefighter, or teacher, I thank them for what they do for a living, because they're making the world a better place. This might be the first time I've ever thanked a business consultant for doing what they do.
