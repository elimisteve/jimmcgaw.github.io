title: Business Card

I had an old high school chum message me a few weeks ago. He mentioned that he had been unemployed for the last few months and was looking for work in the culinary arts.<br /><br />A few days after we spoke, he found himself a job, at which he seems to be very happy. He didn't ask me for my advice about job hunting (and I don't think he would have needed it), but if he had, here's what I would have told him to do (remember, he was looking for work as a chef, so the advice is specific to him):<br /><br />1. Start making every meal at home. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Anything you want, but don't go out to eat.<br /><br />2. Prepare something different each night. Whatever you want to make, but once it's finished, it has to look good.<br /><br />3. Get a digital camera and take a picture of each finished meal before you devour it.<br /><br />4. Write up a brief description of why you chose to make the meal you did. It doesn't have to be a novel, but details help. Why did you choose to mix the ingredients you did? What difficulties did you encounter? Did you have to improvise any detail?<br /><br />5. Once you have several dozen examples, to <a href="http://www.blurb.com/">Blurb.com</a> and turn your photographs and descriptions of your efforts into a picture book. Put your name, contact info, and the most mouthwatering picture you have on the cover. Order as many copies as you think you'll need and, whenever a prospective client or employer asks you for your business card, give them the book.<br /><br />If you want the photos to look good, you'll need way more advice than I can give you...but to get you started, make sure that your white balance is properly set, learn about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>, and for those up-close shots, experiment with your camera's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">depth of field</a>.<br /><br />You might not be a chef, but this could help you make an impression at your next job interview. That goes triple if you happen to be a proctologist.
