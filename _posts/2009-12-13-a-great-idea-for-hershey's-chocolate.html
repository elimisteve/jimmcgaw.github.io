title: A Great Idea For Hershey's Chocolate
---

"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" has a pretty terrible name, when you think about it...there must have been a late-night caffeine-fueled session at Unilever where they really tried to think of a good name to position the product relative to butter. As the sun came up and the tequila supply was starting to run out, they threw up their hands and settled on the one idea written on the whiteboard that wasn't terrible. And to their credit, it worked great. Later, they came out with the spray container for their product and Fabio is remembered well for his role in the ad campaigns.<br/><br/>More recently, we got salad dressings in the same spray bottles. You can buy most of the typical flavors to spray on your salad, and you can count the number of calories easily, as it's only one calorie per spray. Very appealing for those health-conscience people eating their salads at work, at their desks, and need dressing in a convenient dispenser.<br/><br/>Where has Hershey's been during all of this? They still have the syrups--chocolate, caramel, and strawberry--that come in the usual bottle that you can drench ice cream in. Where is the Hershey's chocolate spray? They should formulate a thin consistency chocolate syrup that can be sprayed onto food, and make it one calorie per spray. Running commercials with kids and moms spraying the stuff onto bananas and strawberries as they eat them. Make a caramel one and show people spraying it on their shots of espresso to freshen them up. Only one calorie per spray!<br/><br/>Just do me one favor: if you need a CGI-created spokes-animal to hawk the stuff in your ads, just make sure it's less annoying than the Geico lizard.
