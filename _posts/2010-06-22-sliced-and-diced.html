title: Sliced and Diced

As a programmer, I'll occasionally browse jobs on Dice.com. For the past year, since getting a steady job, I've been getting at least three emails from them a week. The last one I received contained a list of available positions. Here they are:<br /><br />Raytheon Software Engineer  Riverdale, MD<br />Yahoo Senior Java Developer  Richardson, TX<br />Sapphire Project Manager  Chicago, IL<br />Sapient Senior Manager, Technology (.NET)  Boston, MA<br />Amazon Manager - DBA  Seattle, WA<br /><br />Here's the problem with this: Dice.com knows a phenomenal amount about me as a programmer from the information I've entered into their site. Here are just a few of the problems:<br /><br />1. I live in California, and am not interested in relocating.<br /><br />2. I listed no previous experience with Java.<br /><br />3. I've worked as a developer for three years (if that), I'm not going to qualify for anything position with "Senior" in the title.<br /><br />4. I'm 80% sure that there's a "Are you currently looking for work?" question on their site, and I checked "No".<br /><br />Email marketing isn't as easy as it seems, but Dice made a habit of sending me email after email, the content of which had absolutely nothing to do with me or my work experience. When I finally decided to click "Unsubscribe" at the bottom of the email, it took me to a page when they actually seemed surprised: "Are you sure you want to unsubscribe....?"<br /><br />Yep, I'm sure. I, and everyone else, wants to read "me-email". Dice can do better, and I know it, so they've lost the privilege of communicating with me.
