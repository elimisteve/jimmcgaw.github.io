title: Demanding Payment
---

According to a <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/05/netflix-traffic/">Wired article</a> this month, Netflix movies streaming across the Internet are now taking up more bandwidth than BitTorrent.<br /><br />This doesn't surprise me. In the large group of people who downloaded music without paying for it, there were very few people I ever met who said they were downloading music because they didn't want to spend money, or because they hated capitalism. On college campuses, Napster just meant you didn't have to haul your butt to the record store to get music. The fact that it was free, and that all of your friends were doing it too, was really just a bonus.<br /><br />The biggest mistake the music industry ever made was not seizing this as an opportunity. Netflix is great, largely because it's easy...much easier than buying a DVD and wading through the previews they still stick at the beginning. People will willingly pay for things when convenience or belonging is a factor.
