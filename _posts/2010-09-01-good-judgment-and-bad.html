title: Good Judgment and Bad
---

Being human means being susceptible...to erring, to caffeine addictions, and to doing stupid things in order to impress members of the opposite sex. Judgment sneaks in there, too. We're an opinionated animal, so it's rare for us to sit completely on the fence without falling onto one side of any given debate.<br /><br />This isn't always a bad thing. Judgment is bad not when it's wrong, but when it isn't constructive. Judgment will let you find fault with the actions of the people around you, and will give you endless fodder for complaining endlessly about how things aren't as good as they good be. When it's an excuse to practice avoidance, when we use anger as a way of hiding, then it stops being of any use.<br /><br />And yet, when I ask someone for their opinion, I am asking for their judgment. I'm asking for insight. The more lucid and well thought-out, the better, but I'm not looking for a stale regurgitation of plain facts. I'm looking for the line you're drawing in the sand. <br /><br />You won't please everyone, and you might anger a few people, but it just might be the best way to avoid being outsourced.
