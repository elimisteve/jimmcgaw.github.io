Two things you can do as a writer (that is, when you're not writing):<br /><br />1. Look for a publisher.<br /><br />2. Build an audience.<br /><br />Time was, you had to do the first one in order to do the second one. Nowadays, I think you should focus all your effort on #2. It's not easy, but if you pull it off, #1 will take care of itself.
