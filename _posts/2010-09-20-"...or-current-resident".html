title: '"...or Current Resident"'
---

This is a phrase indicative of a complete and total failure on the part of the marketing department that sent it. When a piece of junk mail lands in my mailbox and it's addressed to "James McGaw [or some former resident's name] or Current Resident",  the message I get out of it is: "We don't know or care who you are, we don't really care who opens this envelope, and we're not even sure if you can benefit from what we're selling...but please, for our sake, we hope that <em>someone</em> will open and read this piece of junk."<br /><br />Can't direct mail marketers do any better than this?<br /><br />As an aside, I'm starting to believe that credit card companies that send out multitudes of offers to people are subsidized by several other industries...like paper producers, the post office, and companies that make paper shredders.
