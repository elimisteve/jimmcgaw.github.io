title: When the Game Changes
---

I find history interesting because it teaches you that the changes we're facing today probably won't result in the catastrophe the doomsayers are claiming. <br/><br/>One small example: the creation of libraries (free books!) did not destroy the publishing industry. By the same token, the introduction of the Kindle (digital books!) is not likely to destroy it in the coming years, either. <br/><br/>People like to whine because they hate it when the game changes, especially when they've spent years benefiting from the current set of rules. Usually, the louder ones whine so much because they haven't studied their history.
