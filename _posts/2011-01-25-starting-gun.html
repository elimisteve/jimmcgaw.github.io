There are several words used in dialects around the world that don't have a direct translation into English. I find these cases interesting, since they belie a cultural difference. There are concepts that exist in other parts of the world, to which they've dedicated a word, but we haven't acknowledged them to that extent in English. How, exactly, is that possible?<br /><br />The great thing about the German language is that it's permissible to form new words simply by concatenating several shorter words. Here's one: Torschlusspanik. Literally translated, it means "gate-closing panic", in reference to the fear of diminishing opportunities as one ages.<br /><br />The time to panic about how little time each of us is given, of course, is not when it dawns on you that you're getting older. The time to panic is right now, while you still have plenty of time.
