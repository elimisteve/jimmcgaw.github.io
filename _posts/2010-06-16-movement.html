In an era when I can go online and pay a relatively small fee to file my individual income taxes using TurboTax, why would I go to H&R Block or hire an accountant? Ask a tax accountant this question, and they'll probably get very defensive. Either that, or grumble something about how working with a person is better than working with an online software service. So far, they haven't convinced me of the latter point.<br /><br />I remember visiting Henry Ford Museum in Detroit when I was very young, and there was an exhibit of a robot arm painting car doors. First came the assembly line, which was people specializing in a given area of production. Several decades later, lots of those people were replaced by machines. I wondered: how did that make the people who used to do the painting feel? To have been replaced by a <em>machine</em>?<br /><br />Here's a more personally relevant question: as a computer programmer, why would anyone hire me to work for them when they can get the same job done for cheaper by outsourcing the work to India?<br /><br />These are uncomfortable questions. Most people just avoid asking them or thinking about what the answer might be. This is because there is no easy answer to them. And coming up without an answer is a scary proposition, because it's a little like looking yourself in the mirror at 50 years old and accepting that you're not young anymore.<br /><br />There may not be a fountain of youth, but you can control what you know and what you're capable of. Find the answers to the uncomfortable questions, then broadcast them loud and proud.
