title: Fourth Wall Violation
---

In theater parlance, a character in a movie acknowledging the awareness of, or speaking to the audience directly, is known as "breaking the fourth wall". It's not what John Cusack did in <em>High Fidelity</em> or Steve Carell talking to the camera in "The Office", but instead one of the actors breaking character and addressing the audience at some point in the story when it's unexpected.<br /><br />In real life, breaking character is a useful learning tool. One indication that I've done this, and done it well: after the fact, someone says to me, "Jim, that's so unlike you." It also challenges people to rethink their own assumptions.<br /><br />Suggestion: go break your own personal fourth wall at least once this week.<br /><br />P.S. I wrote a couple of months ago about how I <a href="http://jimmcgaw.blogspot.com/2010/05/passing-along-books.html">buy copies of my favorite books at thrift stores and leave them around town in public places</a>. (Often, people living on the streets will pick them up and read them, if for no other reason than to keep themselves occupied.) Yesterday, I saw a homeless man sitting on a bench reading one of those books. That felt like a small victory.
