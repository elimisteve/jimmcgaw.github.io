When I was in college, I had a friend from Lebanon who used to tell me, at length, about that old truism about how Jews control the media, the banks, etc. Of course he has this belief, and he's angry about it, for reasons that he derived from his father. I thought about this and my first reaction was, "Good for them!" I'm happy for other people and their accomplishments.

I control my toilet, my coffee maker, and when you break it down, maybe about one-quarter of all household appliances. (The rest of them control me.) I have a Twitter account that is followed by about 6 people and what I'm guessing are a couple hundred robots. As far as stewardship, this is really more responsibility than I'm capable of handling. I have a wallet in my back pocket which is in tatters and on the verge of falling apart. Hats off to whoever controls something like a bank or a "media".
