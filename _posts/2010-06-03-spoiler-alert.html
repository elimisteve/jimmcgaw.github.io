title: Spoiler Alert
---

Earlier this month, I was driving across town with a friend of mine to see the movie <em>Iron Man 2</em>. My friend is an aficionado of comic book movies, so he had seen the first <em>Iron Man</em> and mentioned that he thought it was a great movie. En route, I confessed that I hadn't seen the first one and, so I wouldn't be completely lost while watching the sequel, I asked him to describe the plot of the first movie to me.<br /><br />I wasn't always willing to do this. When I was a lot younger, if you had tried to explain the plot of a movie to me before I saw it, I would have thrown up my hands to my ears and started humming, trying to keep you from spoiling anything about the movie. But I don't do that anymore, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, if I hear the plot of a movie, or get the twist ending leaked to me before I see it (can anyone say <em>Sixth Sense</em>?), and if that completely spoils the movie for me, then it probably wasn't a very good movie to begin with. It's the journey, not the destination.<br /><br />But second, and more importantly, I've learned that good experiences in life are not an exhaustible resource. If I have one movie ruined for me, there's lots of other movies out there that I can happily watch instead. And this lesson doesn't just apply to movies. There's always something else I can find to enjoy, whether it's a night out enjoying live music, taking a bike ride somewhere I've never been, or reading a really good book.<br /><br />Occasionally, the experience is ruined by some small factor or it's boring. That's okay...I've got plenty of tomorrows to try again.
