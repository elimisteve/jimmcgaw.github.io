title: Seek Understanding
---

I mentioned a couple of months ago that I set out to read a book a day in 2016. I've fallen woefully short of this&nbsp;nigh-impossible goal&nbsp;so far, but my real aim has been to spend as much of my free time reading as I can&nbsp;manage. It has served well to help me manage my time, and keep me away from things that I might otherwise let distract me.<br /><br />I am trying to approach works of fiction with an open mind. I almost always read non-fiction; I read to learn, not to be entertained. I'm beginning to appreciate the transformative power of narrative when it's expressed in words and not flitting images on a television screen.<br /><br />When I was a freshman in college, I remember being interested in sociology; I was drawn towards it because I wanted to help people, but more importantly, because I wanted to understand the world. I had a lot of trouble reading sociology texts and grasping their lessons about the world at large, so in the end, I turned away from this major and instead got myself a trade.<br /><br />I tried so hard in my youth to understand the world, because I recognized that it was full of problems, and I wanted to help it. Much later on, I settled for merely trying to understand and help the people in the community around me. Eventually, when I found I struggled to do that, I moved on to trying to understand my close friends, acquaintances, and family, because I wanted to deepen my relationships with them, but I'm not sure that I did a good job of that either.<br /><br />Among the non-fiction I'm consuming these days, I'm reading a lot of psychology books written for the masses. While I've dabbled in this genre in the past, I did so with the hope of understanding people around me. I'm finding it more instructive to apply the lessons I'm reading to my own brain.<br /><br />So in the end, I've been driven to understand the one thing that's been staring me in the face the entire time, which I've done a great job of ignoring: myself. That's becoming clearer by the day. It's too early for me to say for sure, but I get the sense that once I understand myself, there's a chance that I just might grow to understand the other people in my life. Maybe I'll eventually understand the larger forces at play in my community. And far off in the distance, there's a slight, <i>very</i>&nbsp;slight, chance that one day I'll even understand&nbsp;the world.
