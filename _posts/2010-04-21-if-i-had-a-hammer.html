title: If I Had a Hammer
---

There's an old expression about how if someone gives you a hammer, suddenly, everything in the world starts to look like a nail. I think it's important that you figure out what kind of hammer you have, and that at any given time, you have something in front of you that needs pounding. <br /><br />And then, keep on pounding till it's finished. Repeat as necessary.
