Last time I checked out at Costco, there was a sign hanging below the register that read, "Only <em>one</em> copy of your receipt can be provided to you."<br /><br />This is a simple point, but stores don't hang up signs like that without them being a response to customer inquiries. If you see a sign that says, "No Dogs Allowed", you can bet it's because people brought their dogs in and the store owner thought, "Gee whiz, I'm gonna put a stop to this by hangin' up a sign." Each sign tells a little story from the store's past.<br /><br />So, the reason that Costco is insisting so heavily on only one receipt per order is that people started asking for multiple receipts. This hardly comes as a surprise, as Costco bills itself as a wholesaler merchant supplying goods to small businesses. Most prudent small business owners keep good records and extra copies of receipts would be useful.<br /><br />What's odd is that, in the face of this request from customers, they decided to view it as a <em>problem</em>, and decided to post a sign in order to eliminate the printing of extra receipts. No dogs allowed!<br /><br />They could have gone the other direction. Instead of refusing to print receipts, let customers get two or three. Then, set up a system online so that customers can opt-in to getting copies of their receipts emailed to their accounts each time they make a purchase. That way, customers could print as many copies as they needed for filing at home.<br /><br />Where could Costco get the money to develop this system? From the marketing budget, of course. Sacrificing a few billboards is well worth it in order to provide convenience to customers...who are probably running around trying to photocopy their one copy of a Costco receipt.
