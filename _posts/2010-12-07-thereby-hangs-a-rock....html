title: Thereby Hangs A Rock...
---

If you attend a craft fair in Southern California, sooner or later, you'll come across someone who's selling rocks.<br /><br />But, these are no ordinary rocks. They're <a href="http://crystal-cure.com/gem-healing.html">healing crystals</a>. Drinkers should grab a peridot for their livers, people with the flu just need some turquoise, and rose quartz is the new age equivalent of Viagra. (Funny, I've never gotten a spam email about rose quartz.)<br /><br />They're not just selling gemstones...they're selling small slices of mythology. Polished or not, people won't just buy a rock, but they will buy a story about how a rock will cure what ails them.<br /><br />People aren't really interested in buying Vitamin C pills, either.
