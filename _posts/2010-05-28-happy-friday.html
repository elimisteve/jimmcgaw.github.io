Before the madness of Friday sets in, here's a song for you to listen to. Wherever you are, turn up the speakers you have and play it out loud for everyone to hear:<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_5ROPCfL9hQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_5ROPCfL9hQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />If you're playing this at work and someone ask you to "Turn that crap down", then quit your job. Life's way too short to spend in close quarters with anyone who can't let this Satchmo classic inspire them.<br /><br />Enjoy the long weekend.
