title: Nobody's Listening!
---

Here's an idea: pick a topic that interests you (preferably one you're familiar with), find a venue that will let you stand up for free, and then offer to speak on that topic for free. Post fliers, or find local organizations that are willing to tell their members about you because what you're talking about is relevant to what they do. You don't have to do a lot. Just spend an hour or so making calls or walking around telling people about it. And then, when it's showtime, get up there and speak with passion. Share your thoughts with people.<br /><br />Why not do this? Because: "Nobody will show up". That might happen, in which case, you're off the hook. You just go home and go to sleep that night. I'd say that just means you need to refine your fliers, tell a few more people, or perhaps you need to tweak the topic slightly. But I still think anyone (that includes you) should consider doing it.<br /><br />It's a chicken and the egg problem that's responsible for so much inertia that lots of people never try speaking up for what they believe in. Don't speak, because no one will listen. Don't write because no one will read. Or, more generally, don't create because no one will appreciate.<br /><br />Appreciation always follows creation, not the other way around. There's no guarantee that anyone will appreciate what you say, but it's up to you to give them the opportunity to do so.
