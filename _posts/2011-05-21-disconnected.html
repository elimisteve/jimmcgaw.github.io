I was born in 1982, which means that, depending on who you ask, I'm either a very young member of Generation X or an old member of Generation Y. <br /><br />People born around this time are two things (according to people who study these sorts of things):<br /><br />1. Old enough to remember a time before our lives were saturated with the Internet.<br /><br />2. Young enough to be as comfortable using the Internet as a so-called "digital native".<br /><br />On a day-to-day basis, I'm pretty wired in, but I can still remember being in high school and spending hours just staring out the window, doing nothing more than letting my mind run wild. <br /><br />I still make an effort to do this on a regular basis: go stare at the ocean, or take a hike in the mountains. No phone, no computer, no video games, no iPod...just me and my mind.<br /><br />I don't think technology is evil, and I'm skeptical of every "technology is making us stupid" type of argument,  but I do think that the ability to step away from technology and just <em>be</em> (in the zen sense of the word) is still massively beneficial to us.
