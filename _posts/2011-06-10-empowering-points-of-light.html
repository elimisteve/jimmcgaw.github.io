My friend Rick shared <a href="http://seawitchery.tumblr.com/post/4070384205/i-started-out-clicking-strategically-and-by-the">this page</a> with me today. Play with it a for a little while, it's amazing. I'll be here when you get back (if you can tear yourself away.)<br /><br />About it, Rick said, "This is inspiring. You create something, so that people can make something beautiful out of it."<br /><br />Well said. Most people build successes not by creating something awesome, but by creating something that enables other people to be awesome.
