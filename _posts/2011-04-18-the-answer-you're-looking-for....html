title: The Answer You're Looking For...
---

...probably isn't where you've been looking for it.<br /><br />The best "aha!" moments of my life have come from answers to questions that I didn't ask. The come from the fringes, from a collision of ideas from two different domains that I never would have put together using logic or reason.<br /><br />A lot of joy and insight has struck me while I've been parked in front of computer because, hey, that's where I spend most of my time and that's the activity that brings me the most joy. But that modus operandi doesn't work 100% of the time, even though my experience has positively reinforced me to keep doing it. If I find myself feeling uninspired browsing the web or writing code, I've found the best thing I can do is step away and start doing more of something else for a while.<br /><br />Would it kill you try something else?
