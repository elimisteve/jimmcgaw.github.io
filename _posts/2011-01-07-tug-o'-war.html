title: Tug O' War
---

In Cambodia, deep in the jungle, lies the ancient temple of Angkor Wat. Inside, there is a large stone carving on a tablet called the "Churning Ocean of Milk", which features many gods and demons in a battle of tug of war with a large snake suspended over an ocean of milk.<br /><br />In this story, the battle rages endlessly between both sides, and the endgame has nothing to do with either side winning...it has to do with the struggle itself. The snake churns the milk, which would otherwise turn sour.<br /><br />Republicans and Democrats will never completely agree with one another. If we follow the track record of history, the arguments over religion show little signs of vanishing anytime soon. Maybe it's not about either side being right, but about the benefits of the debate itself. Put another way: harmony is stagnation.
