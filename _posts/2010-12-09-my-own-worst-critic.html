title: My Own Worst Critic
---

In writing entries on here, there have been times when I spent 30 minutes writing, refining, and editing a single article that I thought would offer my readers insight, and would get them talking to me. Often, when I do that, I hear nothing. <br /><br />Other times, I'm up at 2 in the morning, sleep deprived, and I'll pound out an entry in a few minutes based on a fleeting thought. And surprisingly, there have been times when those quick scribblings have gotten a positive reaction from readers.<br /><br />The truth is, we're generally very bad at separating our own wheat from our chaff. We ignore bad ideas for fear that they won't be well-received and focus on good ones in the hopes they'll be revered. We guess, and we use our best judgment, but too often, we guess wrong.<br /><br />If you have three ideas for novels, three songs you'd like to write, or three paintings you want to paint, don't pick the best one and spend a lot of time refining it. Do all three. Release them into the wild, and let the market pick the best one.
