title: A Hybrid Requirement
---

We need sociologists and business people to start having sex with each other. We need their offspring.<br /><br />Okay, maybe the sex part isn't something we <em>literally</em> need, but we do need a fusion of the two. We need people who have the conscience and socially responsible attitude of sociologists as well as the vision and strategy of entrepreneurs. The people who think in the overlap between sociology's idealism and business' pragmatism are the ones who need to start leading the rest of us.<br /><br />Older companies have a way of functioning that ignores social needs, and they try to write it off by cutting checks to charities in an effort to make up for whatever damage they might be doing for society. Not good enough. People in business need to become sociologists, and vice versa. They need to start companies in this middle ground.<br /><br />At my local Borders, the Social Science section and Business sections are two stories apart from one another. That's too much running around for one person to do.
