title: To An Aspiring Programmer

If you asked me what advice I would give to a young person who is planning to spend their career in a technology-related field, here is what I would offer:<div><ol><li><i>Take initiative.</i></li><li><i>Make things.</i></li></ol><div>To elaborate on these two points a little: put yourself out there. You have no idea what you are capable of until you do. Start things. Persist in them even when they get difficult.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sure, that is not <i>all</i>&nbsp;you need to do in order to be successful. There are other things to consider. You need to figure out how to earn a living. You need to figure out how you work best with other people in the various settings you will find yourself in. You need to figure out (warning: thought-stopping clich√© ahead) what you are really <i>passionate</i>&nbsp;about. And so on.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>The details will depend on who you are and your environment.</div><div><br /></div><div>But if you do the two items listed above, you will have no trouble figuring everything else out when you need to.</div>
