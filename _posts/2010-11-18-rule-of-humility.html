title: Rule of Humility
---

"Rule of law" is a legal term referring to the concept that no sovereign should be above the law. In other words, the President of the United States should be held accountable for the same crimes he commits as any other citizen of this country.<br /><br />I've met my fair share of people who are still furious with Bill Clinton and the fact that he got away with perjury without being impeached. Perhaps it doesn't always work when it comes to enforcing the law...may the client with the best attorney win, in other words.<br /><br />Our politicians shouldn't be above the law, but I don't think a single elected official should be above humility. This isn't just about the President pitching the first baseball at the opening of the season; it's something deeper than that. It's about demonstrating that the power you hold over those you govern is a privilege, not a right, and about living each day to earn it. <br /><br />Ross Perot once said that he never delegated any task that he himself had never done, or wasn't willing to do himself. When you become a leader, perhaps you should put away childish things...but constantly remind yourself that you're not above them, either.
