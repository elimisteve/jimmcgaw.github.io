title: Car Code Readers
---

My check engine light came on the other day. This is the first time this has happened since I jumped onto the yuppie bandwagon and purchased an iPhone for myself.<br /><br />As I opened the trunk to get out my OBDII code reader, I immediately thought to myself: "Why hasn't someone created this idea for iPhones?" The earphone jack on the iPhone can take raw binary data as an input (this is how the <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> app works), so why not create the ability for the car to dump its error codes onto the iPhone and have an app tell you what they mean?<br /><br />Of course, I did some googling, and there are a few people who have done something like this. But my real question when I have an idea that sounds new usually isn't "Why hasn't someone done this?", but instead "Why hasn't the person who <em>is</em> doing this managed to bring it to my attention?"
