title: The Solar Fashion Challenge
---

We have the technology that enables us to harness the power of the sun, even on days that aren't sunny, all over the world. If you own a home, you can throw a bunch of solar panels onto your roof, absorbing and storing kilowatt hours in your basement that saves you money on your utility bills. People are doing it now, but it's not nearly as ubiquitous as you might expect, considering how beneficial it is. Why aren't more people doing it? <br /><br />There are lots of reasons. Economists will tell you people don't do this because the financial incentives aren't in place, which is just a fancy way of saying it costs too much. Political scientists will tell you it's because the laws aren't in place, and they'll blame the powerful oil lobby. Environmentalists will tell it's because we're selfish little creatures who don't care about the planet.<br /><br />There's truth in all those reasons, but there's another, far more important one. Consider, if you will, this image of a bunch of solar panels on the roof of someone's house:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 163px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S3wsr1U9aWI/AAAAAAAAAKA/qtq9b0P4pEY/s320/800px-Solar_panels_on_a_roof.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439271581517703522" /><br /><br />Here's a question for homeowners: do you know why you have a lawn? The short answer is: vanity. The reason you have to drag around a mower once a week during the summer is more for grooming and appearance than for any practical reason. That's not a bad thing, but it's a lifestyle choice we've embraced as a culture in this country.<br /><br />The problem with solar panels is not just one of environmentalism or economics, but also one of <em>design</em>. The engineers have created a solution to the solar dilemma from a technological standpoint, and they believe that's enough. Environmentalists believe that people should line the roofs of their houses with these  things because it's the correct thing to do in the "green" sense. But until someone recognizes that the way our houses look is a source of esteem for a lot of people, solar companies are going to have trouble branding these panels for the mainstream.<br /><br />The solar company that wins big is going to be the one that recognizes they are in the fashion business. They'll bring in designers to work with the engineers to hold a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charrette">charrette</a>, find a solution where the technology and design converge, and they'll make something that looks good enough that almost everyone will want them on their roofs.<br /><br />I'd wear a shirt with solar panels on it to let it charge my iPod while I'm out walking in the sunshine. I think a lot of people would, but it will be hard to convince them to wear anything that doesn't look good.
