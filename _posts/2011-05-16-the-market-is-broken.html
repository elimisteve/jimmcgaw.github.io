title: The Market Is Broken
---

Blogger appears to be having problems. The entries for the last few days didn't get published as hoped and a few I had stowed up got deleted.<br /><br />Problem? Maybe...<br /><br />If you talk to someone who works in the video game industry, they'll tell you that Angry Birds is not that challenging of a game to make. It has its strengths, like the cutesy graphics and sound effects, and it tells a story, but from a strictly technical perspective, it's not that tricky of a game to create. They just used an out-of-the-box physics engine and game framework and have enjoyed runaway success, while some developers who are busy rolling their own physics libraries have yet to see a single dime of revenue.<br /><br />I imagine there are chefs running restaurants preparing excellent food who wonder why on earth people settle for Subway and won't spend the extra $8 a person to eat his great food.<br /><br />An author pours her heart and soul into writing a book that perfectly mirrors the human condition, but nobody buys it because they're busy scooping up the last volume of Harry Potter, which J.K.Rowling didn't seem to put any effort into writing or promoting. How unfair.<br /><br />To the frustrated professional, the market looks broken, because people are supposed to act a certain way, in a <em>rational</em> fashion. And most of us that produce work that doesn't attain a massive following have brains that trick us into thinking that rational people would buy what <em>we're</em> producing, instead of something else. (The ego says, "I'm the best choice.")<br /><br />If you want that job, or want to make a video game, or want to write a book, maybe you should accept that the market is broken and work to fill in the cracks. It's a waste of time and effort to try to fix it.
