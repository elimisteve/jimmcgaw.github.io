title: '"Everyone Should Learn to Code"'
---

I've been hearing this sentiment a lot lately. As someone who has been developing software for a living for almost a decade, I like the audacity of the statement. As if software development is a skill that is applicable in all cases, to everyone, everywhere.<br /><br />Balderdash.<br /><br />If not everyone, then who should learn to code?<br /><br />Easy:&nbsp;<i>Anyone curious to learn about how software works and how it's created.</i><br /><i><br /></i>Maybe this applies to everyone, but I doubt it. Most people will never have a use for software development skills. And most people are not curious about things they do not understand.<br /><br />And why stop at software? Whoever you might be, you really should be trying lots of things. Try starting a business. Try skydiving. Try eating authentic Japanese food.<br /><br />A better maxim to spread around to people might be: "All the world's a playground."<br /><br />In truth, software is going to become more and more pervasive in our lives in the coming couple of decades. People who are capable of writing software, and writing it <i>well</i>, are going to have their choice of jobs for years to come. For that reason alone, I encourage anyone with even a trepid curiosity about coding to give it a shot. If the craft of writing software happens to get your rocks off, it's an absolutely wonderful way to earn a living.<br /><br />I'd love to see the attrition rates of people who have tried it. My guess is that most people poke at some "hello world" code for a few hours, then wander off to do other things. It's really not for everyone, much in the same way that teaching, firefighting, or any number of other professions aren't for everyone.<br /><br />If you're curious about coding, try it. If you don't like it, don't force it. And if it's not to your liking, and you abandon it, and by some coincidence you become my boss in the future, please don't pretend that you understand it. =)
