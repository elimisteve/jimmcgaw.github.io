I am an individual who tends to eschew tooting my own horn, and I also am of the slow-witted kind of character that, when asked a question, doesn't devise an answer until long after it is needed. But yesterday, I had a friend ask me:<br /><br />"Jim, how do you develop your outlook on life?"<br /><br />I thought for a moment, then responded, "Very carefully."<br /><br />To which I would add after the fact: industriously, selectively, enthusiastically, and (to the extent that my character permits) humbly.
