Here's an elevator pitch that I've heard several times from many people since I moved to southern California: healthy fast food. Set up a drive-through where people can get nutritious meals on the go.<br /><br />It's really not a bad idea: offer convenience in the health food market. (It doesn't necessarily have to take the form of a drive-through.) The problem is that people who are eating healthy are trying very hard to distance themselves from the fast food concept, so trying to win them over with that pitch might be futile. And for the droves of people who eat fast food, they don't have a fast food problem: the burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salads work just fine. And the food itself has been commoditized, so it's cheap, and it might be difficult for a place serving vegetables to compete on price.<br /><br />In my mind, here's the springboard for this concept: a drive-through juice bar. There's enough people who frequent smoothie and juice bars to make it a viable concept, and getting a glass of liquid to go is only a stone's throw away from a Frappicino at a drive-through Starbucks. <br /><br />I'm sure that several of these exist, but I'm not aware of one in my own town. Is there one in yours?
