title: Parental Guidance Suggested
---

As soon as a new avenue of media opens up, there's inevitably a bunch of critics that want to get rid of it or control it in some way. Usually, the debate heats up over time, and as more pressure is applied, a compromised is reached.<br /><br />Cinema emerged in the 1920s, and about 40 years later, the MPAA established its ratings system of G, PG, PG-13, and so forth, so that viewers could know beforehand whether the content of the film was appropriate given the ages of those who were going to see it.<br /><br />Television became widespread in the 1950s, and in the mid-1990s--also about 40 years later--a similar ratings system was developed for TV shows. <br /><br />The Internet has been in use by the general public since (circa) 1994. That means we can expect search engines to start putting parental guidance ratings on their search results by the year 2034. But everything seems to happen faster on the Internet, so I'm guessing we might start to see it in the next decade. Honestly, I'm surprised we haven't seen them already.
