title: Awe and Wonder
---

Watched a ten-year-old movie a few nights ago called <em>Wonder Boys</em>, which stars Michael Douglas as a college professor who teaches a writing course. The film loosely revolves around a few students who are aspiring writers and are trying to get their books published. <br /><br />Watching this movie now seems a little strange to me, because all I could think was, "Why don't all of these students just self-publish? Or start trickling their book onto the Internet via a blog?" All the pomp and circumstance of running around looking for a publisher seems passe to me.<br /><br />I still watch period pieces set in the 1960s and catch myself wondering why the characters don't just use their cell phones to communicate. Regarding cell phones, we've accepted that technology changed things. Why does self-publishing still have a stigma associated with it?
