title: Break Stuff
---

Mark Zuckerberg tells the developers at Facebook that they should work fast. He was quoted as instructing his developers, "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough."<br /><br />If you're not a developer, it might not make sense. Or it may sound like the Facebook CEO is a slave driver. He's not. To me, the intent of his statement is clear, and the idea resonates with me. Part of it is that if you give people permission and the space to fail or make mistakes, they can do great things. <br /><br />But it's more about going to the edge. There's a time and place to be methodical; to move slowly; to make sure you know 100% of what you need to before you get started; not to ruffle any feathers; to ask for permission; to do what you know works, and nothing more; to act on certainty, but not on hunches; to walk, instead of run; to wait patiently, instead of gunning it.<br /><br />There's a time and place for those things. Innovation happens somewhere else.
