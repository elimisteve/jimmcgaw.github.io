title: Consistency with Little Yeses
---

There's a line from an old Stephen King made-for-TV movie called <em>Storm of the Century</em> that was mentioned by the villain in the story very early on: "Hell is repetition."<br/><br/>There's also an old sales trick, mentioned in the classic book on persuasion, <em>Influence</em> by Robert B. Cialdini, that you can get people to commit to something by getting them to answer "yes" to a series of small questions that build on one another.<br/><br/>"Do you love your family and want them to be safe?"<br/><br/>"Wouldn't you rather be driving a car that has a proven safety record for your children's protection?"<br/><br/>"Will you buy a car from me so I can earn a sales commission on it?"<br/><br/>If you answered "yes" to the first two, it makes little sense to answer "no" to the last question, and out comes your wallet. Of course, a lot of us are now aware of this tactic, so when we are approached on the street by anyone with a clipboard asking us the first question, regardless of what it is or what our answer would be, we try and skirt the question and walk around them.<br/><br/>The road to Hell is paved with little yeses. Yes, our intentions are good, and that's where the first two "yeses" invariably come from. But, to slightly mangle the words of the annoying salesguy in <em>Groundhog Day</em>: "Watch out for that last step, it's a doosey!"
