My favorite interview question: where do you live now? Recruiters ask this because they need to know if I'm willing or able to relocate to the city in which their office is located. I like this question because I can tell them honestly, "Nowhere. I live nowhere." Of course I go on to clarify what I mean by that, but not before letting a quick moment go by during which they can let their imaginations run with that.
<br><br>
I've told people that I've met recently that I'm homeless, which is <i>technically</i> true, since I've been couchsurfing around with everything I own in my car. My mail is going to my friend's place in Tucson, a friend who calls me once a week to see if I've accepted a job offer yet and gotten my own place so he can stop dealing with my mail.
<br><br>
When I lived in a house, I found that there was an easy way to kill time on a slow day: just rearrange all of the furniture and decorations in a room. During a slow week, you can just rearrange things <i>every day</i>, iterating through all possible combinations of positions of stuff. This is lots of fun to do, but only if you have roommates who get annoyed every time you rearrange everything.
<br><br>
If you're couchsurfing, you really can't do this in other people's homes when you're living with them. I haven't tried this, since I'm hoping to keep the ratings on my AirBNB profile on the positive side. What you can do instead is do this outside: go move your car to another space, and pick up some trash on the street. Or you can throw some new trash on the ground. Just change stuff.

I recently re-watched the movie <i>Seeking a Friend for the End of the World</i>. The film opens with people getting the somber news that the world will end in 3 weeks, at which point an asteroid will decimate all life on earth. So the start of the film is basically the banality of day-to-day life heavily altered by this revelation. No one goes to work, everyone starts to <i>carpe</i> the <i>diem</i>, and so on.
<br><br>
So I watch the first 15 minutes of this movie one morning, even before I had my morning coffee. I have no idea why I started watching a movie in the morning, because I don't typically do <i>anything</i> before I have my coffee. On this particular day, this premise gets stuck in my head. Then I shut it off, have my coffee, and leave the house to go about my day. (Rearranging trash on the street I guess.)
<br><br>
It was odd, because I spent the rest of that day strutting around and talking to people, all of the time thinking to myself, "Damn, all of this is going to get destroyed in 3 weeks." It was actually a very sobering day, because I had this fictional premise stuck in my brain and I operated from it as though it were true. I took absolutely nothing seriously, I made stupid jokes to every stranger I met, and I just had a very enjoyable day because whatever nonsense that makes my brain get anxious on a typical day left me completely alone. It was great.
<br><br>
I don't think most people, myself included, fear death. I'm not afraid of dying. I don't remember when I learned about death, or realized that I was one day going to die, but I think I was really young and I shrugged it off as, "Well, if I'm dead then I don't have to participate in any more spelling bees." I'm not afraid of this impending inevitability; what I <i>am</i> afraid of is that if I make a complete and total ass of myself in some social situation, that I'll have to live for another several decades with the memory of that humiliation. I learned that if we're all dead in 3 weeks, then I don't care how embarrassed I get. By anything.
<br><br>
So I've been chasing that feeling. Sometimes I just pretend that we're headed for Armageddon. I do and say crazy, shameless things to people I don't know. If someone gets annoyed, I just tell them, "We're all dead anyway", which is totally true on a long enough time scale. It really freaks people out. But it shouldn't.
