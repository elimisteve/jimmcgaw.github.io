title: The Great Divide
---

Recently, I <a href="http://jimmcgaw.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-weak.html">wrote</a> that nothing tells you more about a person than how they choose to divide people. Sometimes this is done on the basis on wealth, status, popularity, race, gender, choice of religion, or a variety of other factors. Usually it's a combination thereof.<br /><br />This might make people curious: how do I, personally, choose to divide people? This is a fair question; as much as I like to talk in the abstract on here about moral or ethical principles, I don't always elaborate on the experiences that led me to my conclusions, or discuss how I apply them to my own life.<br /><br />To me, there are people who are aware of their own ignorance, and seek knowledge. There are those who are aware of their own prejudices, and seek experiences and understanding that will allow them to empathize with the targets of their prejudices. There are those who possess an awareness of their past mistakes, and thus their capacity to make future mistakes, and who attempt to learn from them so as to avoid repeating them. There are people who lack awareness these kinds of things, but are actively striving to <i>become</i>&nbsp;aware.<br /><br />Then there's everyone else.
