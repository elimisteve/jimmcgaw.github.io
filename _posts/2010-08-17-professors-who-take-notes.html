title: Professors Who Take Notes
---

I had one professor in college who used to take notes based on what his students were saying. I can't say for sure, but it didn't seem like he was making notes in order to refine his future lectures. Instead, he seemed he was actually making an effort to collect ideas from his students so he could reflect upon them later.<br /><br />I had lots of professors that used the Socratic method in an effort to get students talking and just run down the clock. Even at ten in the morning, this rarely worked. It was almost always preferable to have the professor drone on endlessly, instead of asking questions that none of us had any guts, incentive, or even inclination to answer.<br /><br />But one professor made a genuine effort to listen to us back, in four years of college. That was so unusual that I remember it well. And I paid a great deal of attention in that class because the lecturer made it perfectly clear that attention--and respect--were not just one-way streets.
