title: All Googly-Eyed

Want to know one way you can increase compliance when the honor system is at play? Hang up a set of eyes.<br /><br /><div style="float:left;"><br /><img style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;width: 320px;height:320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/TDlaLfilpdI/AAAAAAAAAM8/iqhxfCte6yI/s320/pet-rocks.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5492520374046664146" /><br /></div><br /><br />There was once a vendor who stocked office break rooms with pretzels. He'd leave the pretzels, along with a locked box, and then leave for the day. People were supposed to take a pretzel and put a dollar into the box. At the end of the day, he'd come back and collect the money from the box.<br /><br />Given a system that's so easy to cheat, you might be wondering how many people took pretzels without leaving a dollar. Turns out, most people were pretty honest, but there was always some theft occurring. (Interestingly, this theft increased as Christmas approached.) <br /><br />What he found (Lord only knows how he thought to test this) was that if he hung up a set of eyes close to the pretzels, the amount of theft dropped dramatically. It didn't matter whose eyes they were. The mere <em>presence</em> of eyes, even cut out of a magazine, made people more honest.<br /><br />We seem to behave better when we feel that someone is watching us.<br /><br />A few days ago, I stumbled across <a href="http://googlyeyewatch.blogspot.com/">this blog that features pictures of googly-eyes glued in random places and to random things</a>. It's a great idea for a blog, the pictures are hilarious, and if you're on Windows XP, I recommend you download your favorite ones and make your screensaver a slideshow of them. (I'm a little peeved at myself for not thinking of the idea first.) <br /><br />But it occurred to me that this is a pretty silly little game that most of us can play. You can buy these googly-eyes at just about any craft store, or if all else fails, you can buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018NBMKU/">125 self-adhesive googly-eyes on Amazon for less than two bucks</a>. (The shipping charge is a little outrageous, but arguably worth it.)<br /><br />I bought five packs of these and am going to descend upon my town with them. I'm going to put them everywhere. I think it's a fun little creative exercise: what can you make look like face with some silly eyes?<br /><br />And I don't know how effective googly-eyes are at changing people's behavior, but maybe we can get people to behave a little better.
