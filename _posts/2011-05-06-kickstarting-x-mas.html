title: Kickstarting X-mas
---

My girlfriend told me about an excellent idea she had. Actually, there are two, but they're to be taken together:<br /><br />1. Start your Christmas shopping now (before the rush.)<br /><br />2. Do your shopping on Kickstarter.com<br /><br />I think this is a great idea. I've been telling everyone I meet about Kickstarter, and that everyone should be planning something to get crowdfunded using the site.<br /><br />But using it for shopping, especially for gifts, makes a lot of sense, simply because it brings together so many wacky ideas by creative people. If you're looking for something unique and interesting for your aunt, that's unlikely to be mass-produced and sold at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for your aunt, you can probably find something both quirky and up her alley on Kickstarter.<br /><br />They make such interesting gifts because you're not just buying a <em>thing</em>...you're also buying the story that goes with it.
