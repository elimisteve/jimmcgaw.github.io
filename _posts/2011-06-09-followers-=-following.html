title: Followers != Following
---

Marketing advice that I got second-hand from the Advanced Search Engine Optimization conference, in a nutshell:<br /><br /><em>If you want to get a thousand fans on Facebook really quickly and cheaply, start running ads in a foreign country that has an extremely low GDP. The ads cost less per click and people's Facebook pages haven't been saturated there yet.</em><br /><br />This isn't bad advice if you want 1,000 Facebook fans, pronto. But it also illustrates the supreme futility of playing the numbers game. Sure, you end up with a bunch of faux fans, but what does that really translate into? (Maybe it looks good on an executive summary for an investor, but that's about it.)<br /><br />Having followers doesn't mean you have a following. And a following, while it takes longer to build, is infinitely more valuable.
