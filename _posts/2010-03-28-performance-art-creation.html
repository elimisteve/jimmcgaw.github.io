title: Performance Art Creation
---

<a href="http://www.chihuly.com/">Dale Chihuly</a> is a world-renowned glassblower. What's interesting about Dale is that he's doesn't just make money by creating great glass artwork and then selling the pieces, but he also draws a crowd that watches him work. People are interested in the <em>performance</em> part of him creating his art, as well as the art itself.<br /><br />That's interesting. There are a lot of wineries around Santa Barbara, where I live. Some of them distinguish themselves by having very odd and unique-looking bottles. Another way of getting attention is by holding an event, like the grape-stomping festival that my girlfriend and I attended a few months ago. <br /><br />I'd say a winery should hold a glass-blowing event. Get a local glass blower to produce some fancy bottles for you, fill them with wine, and then hold a big showing of the glass blower for people to come watch. Remind those who attend that they can <em>buy</em> a bottle of wine, whose bottle was produced by the glass blower, at that event.<br /><br />Offer to put the glass blower's name on the bottle and offer him a portion of what you make from the wine sales. I think you could find a glass artisan willing to do it.
