title: Mindless Negativity
---

Yes, it's true. There are tons of people out there who are characterized by vapid, mindless optimism.<br /><br />Yes, they are annoying. They are a turn-off. They don't actually accomplish much.<br /><br />But it's a massive mistake to correlate their optimism with their vacuous mindsets. Negativity also has the capacity to be mindless. And it my experience, it often is.<br /><br />Don't be overly negative in an attempt to appear smart. Usually, it has the opposite effect. And it makes you miserable in the process.
