---

A DVD isn't just a movie. It's a chance to upsell and cross-sell you.<br /><br />I was going to elaborate in a post on this point, but I came across this picture someone made that sums up the problem quite nicely:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S39KkfFZMxI/AAAAAAAAAKI/wC4JiPyGFKk/s1600-h/pirate-vs-pay.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 310px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S39KkfFZMxI/AAAAAAAAAKI/wC4JiPyGFKk/s320/pirate-vs-pay.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5440148865566716690" /></a>
