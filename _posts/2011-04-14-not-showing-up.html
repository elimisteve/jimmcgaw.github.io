title: Not Showing Up
---

There's an old expression that 90% of life is "showing up".<br /><br />Not that all you have to do is wake up, drag yourself to work, and sit there the rest of the day. That's not 90% of the way there. But once you've woken up, prepared for the day, dealt with the morning traffic, and situated yourself at work, the rest of the day kind of falls into place.<br /><br />It's acknowledging that you've heard what someone else has been saying to you the whole time. That's 90%. Your response is not as critical.<br /><br />It's getting your workout clothes on the in morning and starting to jog. Once you've got the momentum, the workout goes fine.<br /><br />Just as critical, I think, is to figure out where you should NOT show up. Showing up isn't as easy as it sounds. Sometimes, it's a downright drain on your time and energy. Best to figure out what isn't worth the effort, and then stop showing up.
