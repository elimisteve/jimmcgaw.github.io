Here's someone using Blogger in a creative and funny way. It's clear after reading a few of the entries that it's not really a librarian being serious, but a series of jokes in the form of blog posts, probably written by a few people who work at a library and are poking fun at the "librarian" stereotype. The entries are always pithy and short, and I think it's an excellent use of the medium (thanks, Lana):<br /><br /><a href="http://libetiquette.blogspot.com/">Librarian's Guide To Etiquette</a><br /><br />For anyone working in a retail job or any other one where you have to deal with the public, could you create something like this? Seems like a great way to blow off steam, especially around the holidays. Or how about the "Vegetarian's Guide to Dealing with Carnivores", or "Tech Support's Guide to Conceit".<br /><br />I wish I would have thought of this idea when I was working at Wendy's. For that matter, I wish Blogger had even <em>existed</em> when I worked at Wendy's. (That dates me, doesn't it?)
