I saw a movie about five years ago called <em>Art School Confidential</em>. I thought it was a great flick, even though I have a particular distaste for those places where art meets academia.<br /><br />I have a friend who studied Art History in college who tells me that, based on his own experiences in art school, the film was very much true to life. It resonated with him, to some degree of accuracy. Despite this, the film itself is a work of fiction. Like most stories, it's someone else's fantasy. So, it can be dismissed with the catchall "That would never really happen."<br /><br />Someone recommended that I see a movie called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Exit_Through_the_Gift_Shop/70132200?trkid=2361637#height1434">Exit Through the Gift Shop</a> (Netflix link), which begins as a documentary film about street art. I believe that nothing ruins any piece of art like someone trying to verbally explain its meaning or significance, and that goes double for the artist who created it.<br /><br />Ergo, I'll leave it at this: it's a good film. Watch it.
