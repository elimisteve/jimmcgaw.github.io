I realize that the American Dairy Association (is that what they're called? I'm not going to look it up) probably doesn't want to jump on the bandwagon of the latest "energy drink" craze, by if they want kids to start drinking milk to get calcium and healthy bones and whatever, why don't they create a version of milk that has caffeine in it?<br/><br/>Call it "PowerMilk" and sell it in vending machines in high schools across the country. Make it more convenient than the little boxes you can buy in cafeterias. That's why I drank lots of soda pop when I was in high school: it was far more convenient to stick a dollar in a machine than to stand in line waiting to deal with those grumpy ladies who worked in the cafeteria.<br/><br/>It's similar to taking advice from Mary Poppins about a spoonful of sugar. If a small dose of caffeine helps the milk go down, then why not put it into milk to encourage kids to drink more of it?
