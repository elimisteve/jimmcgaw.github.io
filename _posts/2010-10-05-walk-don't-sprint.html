title: Walk, Don't Sprint

When we present a person with a new thought or idea, we're often too quick to assume that the other person is going to see things our way very quickly. The problem with trying to change someone's mind in the space of a single conversation is that we don't reach conclusions...we accrue them over time. <br /><br />By the time we start talking to someone about a new idea, there's a good chance we already have several minutes of thoughtful contemplation under our belts. We took our time, considered different perspectives, and after all of that reflection, we reach the conclusion. The person listening, on the other hand, is starting at zero.<br /><br />So how do we expect someone else to see things our way within ten seconds?
