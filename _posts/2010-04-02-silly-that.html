title: Silly, That
---

I'm not sure what was going through the heads of the first people who decided to take the green beans from the coffee plant, burn them, drip hot water through them, and then drink the resulting liquid.<br /><br />That's not exactly how it happened, but you get the idea. Getting from green beans to the final coffee beverage that all of us drink today is not logical at all. I imagine that the process of getting the green beans from their natural state into a liquid form that was drinkable took all kinds of trial and error, done by people who couldn't say with any certainty that they'd end up producing anything worthwhile.<br /><br />Just the idea of taking green coffee beans and turning them into a hot drink seems a little silly, when you think about it. We can thank those of our ancestors that chose to persist and follow through on something silly the next time you get a cup o' Joe.
