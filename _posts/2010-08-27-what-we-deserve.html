title: What We Deserve
---

There are some days when I wake up, days when my head isn't so far up my own ass that I take everything I have for granted, and I start to wonder how I got so lucky as to be where I am. I start to question whether or not I deserve everything that I have.<br /><br /><em>Deserve</em> is a funny word, because it's a means of evaluating the balance between the merits of one's actions and the good (or bad) fortune a person incurs. It's a subjective thing to try and define, so ultimately, most of us end up concluding that we deserve what we have.<br /><br />Of myself, I'm still skeptical. I've had a lot of good luck in my days (so far) and I have a hard time convincing myself that I've really done anything to earn it. Dumb luck, I suppose you could call it. But ultimately, it doesn't do anyone any good to sit idly and question whether they deserve what they have. A much better question to ask: what are you going to do with your good fortune now that you have it?
