title: Squeak Squeak Squeak
---

There's an old expression about how the squeaky wheel gets the grease. That is, the person who complains the loudest, or the most, gets the attention and catered to. It has a negative connotation, because generally the squeaky wheel is given the most attention even at the expense of serving the other, quieter wheels.<br /><br />If there's any lesson we learn repeatedly in grade school, it's not to squeak. Avoid making any squeaky sound at all costs. The grease is not something we want, but something we're afraid of: criticism. Stand out, get noticed, get ridiculed. That's the drill. So we shut up and squeak less.<br /><br />I think that as long as you're discerning about when you squeak, and what you squeak about, that it's not a bad thing. The expression and our negative perception of placating the squeaky wheel comes from squeakers that are voicing silly complaints or asking for more than they're due.<br /><br />As long as you're reasonable, we should probably aim to squeak more. The grease you get might not just be criticism, but the change you've been hoping for that helps you and lots of other people.
