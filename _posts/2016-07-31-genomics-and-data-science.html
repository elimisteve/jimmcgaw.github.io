title: Data Science and Genomics
---

I've been reading a ton of technical books lately. The technical world at large, and in many ways now, the
entire world at large, has an ever-burgeoning problem with volumes of data. As a society, we're producing more
of it than ever before, in almost every domain and every industry. There's far more data than there are people
who are capable of making sense of it. If you want to enter a technology field, and math doesn't scare you,
consider data science.

I've been focusing my efforts on learning 
how data science will help in the field of genomics. Medicine is likely to become more personalized over the
next century, and treatments, preventative or reactive, are going to be increasingly based on what's in an
individual's genome. Genomic information doesn't just tell you which diseases you're at risk for, but also how
effective any given treatment might be in the face of a particular diagnosis.

I spent a lot of time a few years ago intensely studying the domain of machine learning and its variety of
algorithms. This required me to go back and re-learn statistics, calculus, and learn linear algebra (which is awesome).
What I lacked during this time in my life was a problem that I was interested in tackling. Studying machine learning
without a goal in mind is a little like studying website programming without any idea of what kind of website you
need or want to build. It's arguably a useful skill to have knowledge of, but when you're studying, it can feel
a little abstract.
