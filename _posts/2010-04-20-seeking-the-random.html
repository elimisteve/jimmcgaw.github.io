title: Seeking the Random
---

Wherever you're reading this, scroll to the top of this page you're on and have a look at the links. Next to the search box and the "Report Abuse" link, there's a link with the text "Next Blog >>>". Go ahead, have a look...I'll wait here until you get back.<br /><br />See it? If you click it, it will propel you away from my blog and into another random person's. Some days, when I get bored, I'll use that link to jump around Blogger and see what other random people are sharing with one another.<br /><br />Most of the time, all I learn is that most people use Blogger to share fairly uninteresting photos of their family, and lots of people write one entry per year in which they say, "Sorry I haven't been blogging, I'm going to try and do it more often!"<br /><br />But the "Next Blog" link offers a certain measure of controlled serendipity. I'm curious to know just how many people take advantage of the fact that, at any given time, you can use Blogger to effectively browse people and their ideas, entirely at random. It's akin to wandering around Borders looking for a good book to read...maybe one that you weren't looking for the first place.
