title: First, Do No Harm
---

A co-worker of mine made an interesting point yesterday: ten years ago, socially responsible consumers were looking at the clothes they were buying and trying to determine if they were having a negative impact on the country where they were produced. People didn't want to buy sneakers if they were put together by children working in a sweatshop somewhere in Asia.<br /><br />The problem with this is that while this might prevent some undue suffering by nudging the invisible hand, it does nothing to propel the products being produced in a better direction. A much more common trend these days is people looking not only for products that do no harm, but ones that actually generate a positive social impact. <a href="http://www.toms.com/">Tom's Shoes</a> is probably the best example of this kind of a product with the giving built in.<br /><br />A sign of the times. And a promising one, at that.
