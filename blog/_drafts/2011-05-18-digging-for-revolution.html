Here's a quote I saw painted on a door at a local community college. I've heard it before, and chances are good that you've read it several times before as well. Doesn't matter if you've read it 6,000 times and this is the 6,001st time you've seen it, here it is again:<br /><br /><em>"Art is either plagiarism or revolution."</em> -Paul Gauguin<br /><br />Now that's brilliant in its brevity. I don't care whether or not you even consider yourself to be an artist...the work you do, whatever it might be, could benefit greatly from figuring out how Gauguin's words apply to it.
