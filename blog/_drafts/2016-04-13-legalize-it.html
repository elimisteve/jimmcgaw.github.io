Let's take a break from all of the serious philosophizing about right and wrong that I so consistently do on this blog and chat about something else for a bit. Let's talk about weed.<br /><br />It's interesting to me that in the past 5 years, the United States has managed to make as many changes in the policies surrounding marijuana as it has. If you had asked me in 2010 if it were possible to get to where we are now, in 2016, I wouldn't have believed you. If you had told me we'd get here, I would have been obstinately skeptical of you.<br /><br />I'd like to spend a little bit of time writing about this not because I have a strong opinion about this issue one way or the other, but because the discussions I've heard around this issue are representative of the kinds of discussions you hear about political issues these days. Namely, in these conversations, people put themselves in orbit around a particular issue, instead of around their own value systems.<br /><br />The arguments I'm going to make here are largely my own responses to individual and anecdotal points I've heard made; I haven't analyzed the data around this issue in depth in order to determine how it affects society at large. I suspect that, if you're reading this, you're likely to approach what I say with your own ingrained biases about the issue. In writing this, I'm merely trying to share my own ingrained biases, and, in writing about them, force myself to think them through.<br /><br />I spent four years in college, and I've lived for the better part of the last decade living in southern California. It should go without saying that I'm very well acquainted with the arguments that people use to make a case for the legalization of marijuana.<br /><br />Take this one: alcohol is legal, and alcohol kills many, many people every year. Marijuana has never killed anyone. Since the first is legal, it makes no sense to keep the second one illegal. We should be consistent in permitting our citizens access to recreational substances. We can Cochronize the argument thus: <i>if no one dies, you must legalize.</i><br /><br />What I hear from this argument isn't that we should legalize marijuana, but rather that we should reconsider whether or not alcohol <i>should</i>&nbsp;be legal. It is undoubtedly true that alcohol consumption is a major cause of death worldwide. Of course, in juxtaposing the two, you're putting marijuana in a very unfavorable light. By putting it into the same category as alcohol, I'd say you're unlikely to convince anyone to warm up to the idea of legalizing it. Why should we condone another evil just because there's another, arguably much worse evil that's already legal?<br /><br />This also falls back on the simplifying assumption that the only true harm wrought on society by alcohol is death. Alcohol consumption also causes diseases, both physical and mental. There's widely circulated propaganda that claims that compounds in marijuana, when smoked, actually <i>prevent cancer</i>, but the ACA has yet to accept this, and other respiratory illnesses besides cancer (like emphysema) can also be caused by smoking.&nbsp;Al-Anon meetings around the country are filled with people who have escaped death, but who have personal stories about how their abuse contributed to the emotional detriment of themselves and those around them.<br /><br />At least the people who make this argument are being honest in drawing this comparison: both alcohol and marijuana are substances which have the potential to be abused by the people who use them. Rampant alcohol abuse might be an indicator of the collective emotional distress of our society; in comparing the two in this way, here's the question you make me ask myself: can't they both be abused by a person in an effort to avoid dealing with emotional pain? If this is the stance you take, shouldn't we instead be searching for a means of helping others work through this emotional pain instead of legalizing a new means of deadening it?<br /><br />This is not a firm case <i>against</i>&nbsp;legalizing marijuana, but rather, I'm poking holes in this one particular argument that people make <i>for</i>&nbsp;legalizing it. In order to answer this question, I'd be curious to know how many people who consume alcohol in their formative years end up in a recovery program. For many people, the consumption truly is just recreational, and they do it throughout their lives without any adverse effects. This wouldn't help answer the question, but it calls out one of the assumptions that's implied in my reasoning: that substance use / abuse is always tied to some emotional problem. I know this isn't true. But every argument you make is usually predicated on some unspoken assumption; the discussion must help surface these assumptions or else truth might elude us.<br /><br />Recently, I was chatting with a friend about this. I was debating the issue, taking a stance against his own, expressing my own reservations about society moving towards making marijuana more permissive. He posed a fair question to me: do I think that people would stop doing it altogether if it were outlawed?<br /><br />Of course not. Marijuana has been illegal for the past century in just about every country in the world, and if not illegal, its use has been legally restricted. This has done very little prevent people from doing it. In coming back to the alcohol simile, we can point to the Prohibition era in US history to see that outlawing alcohol didn't prevent its availability to and consumption by a generation abuzz with jazz and ragtime.<br /><br />There's plenty of precedent that makes it clear to us that keeping marijuana illegal isn't going to act as a <i>complete</i> deterrent, but it would have partial deterrent effects. I was born into a world where, as a matter of public policy, alcohol and tobacco were legal, and marijuana was quite staunchly illegal. This has undoubtedly influenced the manner in which I've approached these things; it's influenced the people around me, and the larger culture in which I was brought up. It seems that a child born 15 years from now in the US will enter a world where the
