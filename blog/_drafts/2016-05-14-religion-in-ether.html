People often ask me what I chose to start studying religious scripture. There's an old, possibly apocryphal tale about someone walking into W.C. Fields' dressing room and catching him reading a Bible. In an effort to cover it up, he quickly said, "I'm looking for loopholes." Usually that's the answer I offer.<br /><br />I became interested in it because it seemed like the quickest possible route to understanding other religious people. As one example, when studying scripture, I read the New Testament. Why is this useful? When I meet a person who calls themselves a Christian, I can now ask them questions about their faith and how they put what they're read into practice. I can ask: why did you reach that conclusion? How has this helped you in your life? Which messages from it are most useful to you?<br /><br />The same goes for other religions. You can ask a Muslim which parts of the Qu'ran do the most to contribute to the quality of their lives and how they've reached that conclusion. Buddhist scripture is less standardized, so you can ask not only about what they've learned and how they practice, but which scripture they've chosen to focus on.<br /><br />I remember being fascinated by religion when I was in elementary school. I'm not sure why, the notion of this spiritual thread that ran through the universe was interesting to me. Perhaps in my youth I had just been brainwashed by the "liberal media" into believing there might be some kind of reality beyond our own.<br /><br />I'm still fascinated by this,
