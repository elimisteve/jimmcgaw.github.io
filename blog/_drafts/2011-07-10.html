When was the last time you were reading some random article or browsing a thread someplace on the Internet and you left a comment on it? I'm not talking about Facebook or Google+, where you're among friends. I'm talking about a place where you're a stranger, and no one knows your name until you enter it into the "comment" field. How often do you do this?<br /><br />Personally, I have some strong opinions, and inwardly, I usually formulate some kind of response to the stuff I read, but I very, very rarely ever post comments in random places on the Internet. As a matter of fact, most of what I consume disappears into the seemingly empty abyss between my ears. Everything I consume influences me, but I don't necessarily repeat or share everything, because there's too much.<br /><br />Most people are like this, I think. Sure, there are some people who have something to prove, so they're always commenting on everything, either because they want to change people's minds by yelling or they want to make silly jokes. But if I had to guess, I'd say most people are like me: they don't repeat what they read or hear.<br /><br />So, you have something you want to say, and you want lots of people to hear it. It's a new product or a political candidate or you're trying to stop city hall from cutting funding to the fire department. Cool! You need get get people's attention and generate interest. <br /><br />But you have to deal with people like me. You can tell me, and maybe some other people, but we won't necessarily tell anyone else. Which is what you want to have happen.<br /><br />The trick here is idea diffusion. (This isn't a new idea...Everett Rogers made this his life's work over the past century.) Let's start with some contrived example: you want to sell some new kind of plastic building blocks, like Legos. It's not a bad idea. But if I hear about your new product, it's not going to interest me enough to say anything to anyone else.<br /><br />From the standpoint of getting things to diffuse among human beings, most things are effectively ignored. I won't pay any attention to your new Lego-type toys because I already have Legos, and I'm not looking to replace them.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I wrote a book. On Amazon, it's gotten mostly good reviews and a couple of negative ones. Do the negative ones bother me? Hell no! What those bad reviews mean is that two people felt strongly enough about what I wrote to post something. What actually bothers me is that there are so _few_ reviews at all. If I had done things right, I'd expect a higher count of both positive and negative comments.<br /><br />You're trying to start a game of telephone, and you can't control it. You know the old saying that goes, "You'll either love it or hate it"? I think there's a seriously effective strategy buried in that expression. Because if no one loves or hates your idea, no one's going to pass it on.<br /><br />Forget the quality and merits of your idea. Yes, I believe they're real and I believe they exist. But they're irrelevant! It does not matter one bit how cool your new Legos are. If people won't turn to their co-worker or friend and say, "Check out these new toy building blocks...", then you need to start over.<br /><br />You don't have to set out to piss people off. Actually, that's a bad idea. But if you're filtering your own mental ideation, err on the side of choosing the ideas that have the _potential to diffuse_. You might guess wrong. Not every article will be shared. Not all products purchased. But each person is passionate about a certain small array of things. If you're not aiming for one of them, then go back to the drawing board.<br /><br />Inciting compulsion in the human breast is the hardest task of all! You cannot beg for it. You can't try and do it constantly. And you have to start with a solid idea.<br /><br />Obvious? Maybe! I'll stop saying this as soon as I stop encountering people who're trying to raise venture capital in order to build "the next YouTube" or "the next Facebook".
