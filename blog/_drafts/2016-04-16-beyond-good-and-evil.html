A friend of mine brought up Christianity to me recently. "I think Jesus really was just a crazy person," he told me.&nbsp;He went on to explain that he was disturbed by the notions of heaven and hell that a Christian friend of his had told him about at length.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In terms of interpreting scripture, most of our ideas about this seem to have come from the things Jesus said about the "kingdom", or the "kingdom of heaven". All of these comments could be construed to point to the existence of an afterlife. From my own reading of scripture, I see the notion of eternal punishment or eternal bliss, in a life following this one, as a conjecture. It's also a conjecture with extremely weak support.</div><div><br /></div><div>Christian writers and apologists often caution against seeing Jesus as a mere man who taught moral philosophy. You cannot accept and apply the moral lessons he taught, but also reject the supernatural actions attributed to him, such as the casting out of demons or the walking on the water. Sure, He said, "Love each other", and this certainly seems like good life advice...but He also went around claiming to be the Son of God who would rise from the dead three days after being killed, and who would return to earth from a place in the sky to punish all the people who didn't choose to believe in Him. If you believe all He said, then you have to believe he was the Son of God and worship Him. If you think He was merely a man who taught ethics about how to live, then he was indeed as my friend claimed: a crazy person who, despite all that good advice, had delusions about Himself being God's son.</div><div><br /></div><div>I disagree with this latter point. The notion that you have to accept everything Jesus said, or reject all of it, is a false dichotomy. It's predicated on the inference that every quote attributed to Jesus in scripture was transcribed with 100% accuracy. It assumes that the writers of the gospels took no liberties to adjust or embellish the message they hoped to convey to readers. Technology didn't exist then as is does now; we know paparazzi weren't following Jesus around with tape recorders, scribbling notes in the Aramaic equivalent of journalistic shorthand.</div><div><br /></div><div>There's an old proverb that says it's better to trust the faintest ink over the sharpest memory. In the case of scripture, we have faint ink that was transcribed from what we can only assume were "sharp memories" on the part of the writers, who they themselves weren't recording everything from their own memories. The writers themselves may have had an agenda besides merely transcribing precisely what Jesus is supposed to have said. In accepting the Gospels as gospel, I'm understandably cautious about throwing all skepticism to the wind.</div><div><br /></div><div>But I'm not saying we should reject the notion of heaven and hell, as afterlives following this one, because they're supernatural in nature, or because there's a lack of evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support their existence. I'm saying that if you comb through the Bible, the notion of these afterlives <i>simply isn't there</i>. You can find it if you want to, but it's a whole lot easier not to find it if you clear your mind and don't go looking for it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Luke 17:21 claims that Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is within you." Another translation reads, "The kingdom of God is in your midst." From the context, it doesn't sound like this kingdom is something people are supposed to wait to come to them at some future date. And Jesus wasn't talking to dead men, so I wouldn't guess that it's something we can expect to encounter when we die.</div><div><br /></div><div>My take on this: Jesus taught that we are punished for our sins, or more precisely, <i>by </i>them, in this life.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I can imagine a situation very early on in the Christian church, in which an apostle or some Christian fellow is prosthelytizing to a group of people. He teaches them that they should follow the&nbsp;</div>
