About two years ago, I moved back from California to my state of origin, Michigan. We settled on what is undoubtedly the hippest place in the entire state: Ann Arbor. I love this city. Home to the University of Michigan, its streets and coffee shops are brimming with people who are studying multitudes of subjects, most of which I can hardly begin to appreciate. Like a lot of other university towns, it's possessed by a wonderful sense of culture, even beyond the students.<br /><br />I lived here for about a year, during the winter of 2014. I was still working remotely for the job I had in California, but I went to Meetup groups to connect with people working in science and technology. Early on, I offered that I had just relocated to Ann Arbor.<br /><br />"Where from?" people always asked.<br /><br />"Santa Barbara," I'd reply.<br /><br />In each case, this would be followed by the invariably identical response: a look of genuine shock, and the question, posed in all seriousness, "Why on earth would you do <i>that?</i>"<br /><br />"Family," I would offer, in truth. This seemed to satisfy them. But if I went on to talk about how thrilled I was to be living in Ann Arbor, and how much I loved the city, this usually received a lukewarm response. I think they must have assumed I was merely trying to placate them. <i>No one could like Michigan more than California.</i><br /><i><br /></i>In truth, I overheard a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;of conversations that winter in coffee shops where people were discussing programming, and they'd very often discuss their plans to "find a way to get out to California". In earnest, I spent the winter trying to find <i>someone</i>&nbsp;in the city who was happy to be living in Ann Arbor, who didn't feel trapped there, or who didn't feel like it was a stepping stone on their way to someplace better. I found plenty of people who were older, with established roots, families; but among younger people with greater mobility<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit that usually I heard these conversations while working on my laptop for a company in California. It was generally reaffirming to hear that so many people were pursuing what I myself possessed; <i>bully for me!</i>&nbsp;But what's happening here? Is it the prevalence and appeal of geek culture all of the sudden? Mainstream society has embraced nerdom, so instead of politely walking by and hoping it doesn't engage us in conversation, everyone's rushing towards to its supposed mecca? Why have we made ourselves
