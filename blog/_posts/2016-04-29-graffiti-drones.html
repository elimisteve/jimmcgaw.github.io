title: Graffiti Drones
---

I'm a big fan of street art. I'm also a technologist. I never put these two together, but some intrepid person realized that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We12p6yvNW0" target="_blank">drones can carry cans of spray paint</a> and reach surfaces that a single person might not be able to.<div><br /></div><div>They don't do a whole lot in this video, other than deface a large billboard ad. It's barely discernible, even in daylight. But I'd guess there's a street artist out there right now who's programming a drone swarm, each sporting a different color, to quickly and stealthily vandalize the side of a building.</div><div><br /></div><div>The future never seems dull.</div>
