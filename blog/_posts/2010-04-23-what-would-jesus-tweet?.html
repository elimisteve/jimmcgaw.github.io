title: What Would Jesus Tweet?
---

Perhaps the best question to ask first and foremost is whether or not, if Jesus were around in this day and age, with access to our technology, would he use it?<br /><br />I don't think it's a sacrilegious question to pose. (Although, if anyone thinks it is, I apologize for that). In his day, Jesus had twelve disciples that followed him around. He traveled around spreading his own message of hope, and the speed at which that message could travel was limited by how fast a person could travel. Which, at the time, was very, very slow. <br /><br />Think about how many people could follow him on Twitter now. Think about how much faster he could have spread his message to people given the tools afforded us by social media. Given the opportunity, I'm almost certain he would embrace the tools as they exist to give people hope.<br /><br />If you do a people search on Twitter for "Jesus", quite a few result come up for people who are tweeting using the name in some capacity. (My guess is that none of them are the real Jesus...just a hunch.)
