title: What Do You Do When You Aren't Doing What You Do?
---

Whenever we're in social situations with strangers, like at parties or seated on a plane, the first question we tend to ask one another is "What do you do?" This is surprisingly pervasive in our culture, and I'm told that it's a less common question to ask in other places in the world. The implication, of course, is that we're defined in large part by what we choose to do for a living.<br /><br />The problem with this is that I remember being 19, in college, and a college advisor put his proverbial gun to my head and ordered me to pick a major, lest I not graduate in four years' time. This at a time when I had barely figured out who I was or where I fit into the world, and I was supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my <em>life</em>. Talk about pressure. I've spoken to lots of people since then who have told me they had a very similar experience. So how is it that a decision made by many people in haste, out of necessity, is something that we let determine who we are?<br /><br />It's a good first question to ask strangers: What do you do when you're <em>not</em> at work? That question tends to get people talking enthusiastically, and the answers are almost always more interesting than those to questions about work. Sure, I do meet people who like what they do for a living, and that's pretty refreshing when it happens, but there's usually more passion in what people are doing in their off hours.<br /><br />Are you delighted to talk about the work you do when you aren't at work? It's a good question to ask yourself on a Monday morning as we get back to the grind.<br /><br />(P.S. Friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky...does that mean Monday the 13th is lucky?)
