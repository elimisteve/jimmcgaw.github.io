title: Jiffy Lube Is On the Right Track
---

I have complained in a few prior posts about the quality of coffee that auto maintenance places offer to the people sitting around in their cramped and uncomfortable waiting rooms. It seems like spending a few extra bucks for a decent coffee machine and decent coffee is pretty low-hanging fruit, as far as things you can do to keep customers happy while you're working on their car.<br /><br />I went to a local Jiffy Lube recently to get my oil changed. I've been there three or four times in the past, but this time, there was a new coffee machine sitting in the corner:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S6QEqQAcxPI/AAAAAAAAAKY/k-HHQFBszt0/s200/0319001319.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450486572923012338" /><br /><br />This contraption takes little single plastic packaged cups of group coffee. You put one in the top, put a cup under the spout, hit brew, and it spits out a small cup of freshly brewed coffee. The grounds weren't top of the line, and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to actually use the damn machine (there weren't instructions, so I just started pushing buttons half expecting to break it.) But I'm super glad they decided to swap out the old swill-filled carafe for the new offering. I sat there in the waiting room for the 20 minutes the oil change took, happily reading and sipping my coffee.<br /><br />(In case you're wondering, more than one person in the waiting room gave me a strange look for taking a picture of the coffee machine with my phone.)
