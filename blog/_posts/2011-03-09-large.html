Why are we always so attracted to massive ideas?<br /><br />Talk about opening a coffee shop, creating an iPhone app for checking traffic reports, or say you're going to write a screenplay that's reminiscent of <em>Crash</em> that will require massive financial backing, then encouragement will beat a path to your door. Do it, everyone says, because they know that if you win, then you win big. At least, big enough to make it worth your trouble.<br /><br />But if you suggest creating a web site to, say, sell special tools for tending orchids to enthusiasts, then you're met with doubt: "Eh, how many orchid enthusiasts are there out there, really?"<br /><br />All else being equal--namely, the certainty of a payoff--then the size of the payoff should guide the decision. But the certainty between large and small isn't always comparable.
