Simple question: if there were a proposed change to be made in this country that would arguably leave everyone better off in some important way, but it put you out of a job, would you fight the change?<br /><br />I use the word "arguably" very deliberately, because I learned very quickly as an adult that 1. almost everything is arguable, and 2. if it's arguable, it will be argued.
