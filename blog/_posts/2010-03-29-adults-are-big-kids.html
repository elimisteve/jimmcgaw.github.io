title: Adults Are Big Kids
---

That goes triple in Vegas. And you know what kids like? Dinosaurs.<br /><br />I wonder, then: why isn't there a big house of mechanical dinosaurs that people can visit in Las Vegas? Why isn't there a dinosaur-themed casino, with jungle exhibits and big fire-breathing robots and slot machines with T-Rexes plastered all over them? Why isn't there a <em>Cirque du Dinosaur</em> show people can go see when they're wasted?<br /><br />You might say that dinosaurs lack the glamor of Paris or Caesar's Palace. Explain, then, what Treasure Island is doing on the strip?
