title: Obviously
---

I once read somewhere that you should be cautious with your use of the word "obviously". If something really is obvious, then pointing it out is redundant. If it isn't, then it's diminutive to the person you're talking to.<br /><br />A lot of what I write on here is probably stating the obvious to someone. It's very presumptuous of me to write these little bursts of my thoughts and expect anyone to get something out of them. My thoughts on that: if you read something on here and the point I make it obvious to you, then it wasn't meant for you. <br /><br />There are very few new ideas being generated amongst writers. Ergo, everything is obvious to <em>someone</em>. If you start the process of ideation with the presumption that what you're saying has to be meaningful and insightful to everyone, you'll end up saying very little, if anything.<br /><br />Obviously.
