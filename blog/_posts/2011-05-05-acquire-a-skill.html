title: Acquire a Skill
---

Here's the one-line summary of the directive in today's post: <em>acquire a useless skill</em>.<br /><br />Daymond John, the founder of the FUBU clothing line, was able to successfully launch his own line of clothes (and become a millionaire) because he knew how to sew.<br /><br />I'm willing to put good money on the fact that while he was growing up, there was very little reason for him to learn to sew. It was just something his mother taught him how to do. He learned it, even though there was likely no good reason for him to learn how to do it at the time. As a matter of fact, for most males growing up in this country, there are lots of decidedly "good" reasons <em>not</em> to learn to sew. (To avoid being made fun of, etc.)<br /><br />And yet, he did it anyway, and it worked out very well for him. Lesson learned: the skills you have in your arsenal matter a great deal, and to any budding entrepreneur, <em>no skill is 100% useless</em>. It's applicability might be not be immediately apparent to you, but the further away any skill's domain lies from your own, the closer you should look at it.
