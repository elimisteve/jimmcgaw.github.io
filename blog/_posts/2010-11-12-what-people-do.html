title: What People Do
---

What I see a lot of people doing:<br /><ul><br /><li>Trying to get others to take an interest in them, but not making any effort to take an interest in others.</li><br /><li>Talking and trying to get others to listen, but not listening to others.</li><br /><li>Trying to hide their mistakes, instead of acknowledging and apologizing for them.</li><br /><li>Expending tons of energy to get other people to change their minds, but expending almost none trying to change their own.</li><br /></ul><br />Do the former and you're a statistic. Do the latter and you become valuable.
