title: Where's the Cough Medicine?
---

If you're running a small grocery or convenience store, why is the cough medicine hidden in some random place back amongst the rest of the merchandise in your store? Think about the people who are coming into your store and looking for the DayQuil...they're probably:<br /><br />1. In a hurry to get what they came for and leave.<br />2. Infirm.<br /><br />Why sandwich this stuff in aisle 9 between the shampoo and soluble fiber? Sure, I know that's where the guys in the corporate office <em>told</em> you to put it in order to maximize ROI or whatever. Why not put it right at the front of the store, in a very obvious display shelf, so people who are miserable and sick with colds don't have to go digging for it? Given the opportunity to help those people get in and out quickly with what they need, why not make it as easy as possible?<br /><br />Besides pleasing customers, you're also ensuring that potentially contagious customers are not wandering around your store, coughing all over everything as they search for the Sudafed, and asking the clerks for assistance...increasing the risks that your employees will end up sick themselves.<br /><br />If you really want to minimize the amount of contact these sick people have with anyone in your store, if you can, put a vending machine containing the most popular cold remedies right by the entrance, much like they do with iPods in Macy's. That way, it's possible for someone to walk no more than 5 feet into your store, buy what they need, and leave without talking to anyone. <br /><br />If lines start forming at the vending machine, put free samples of Purell within reach. What would the CDC do?
