title: Fear Is Where It's At
---

So, you've been meaning to get around to recording that song, or writing that book, or designing and selling that T-shirt, or painting that abstract self-portrait for the ages. I'm sure there are lots of reasons, but is one of them because you're slightly afraid?<br /><br />It's scary to put your art out there for everyone to see, judge, critique, and so on, because, by extension, they're judging <em>you</em>. That's a scary thing to face. Even just thinking about it makes me cringe.<br /><br />The value in what you create lies in that very fear. The value of your art stems from the fact that, in producing it, you've overcome the fear that kept you from creating it in the first place. If it were easy, more people would do it. Scarcity creates value, and since so few people make the leap to overcome their own fear, you have the opportunity to create something really valuable.<br /><br />It takes guts to speak in your own voice, ignoring the devil on your shoulder, and that is a big part of what makes others admire it.
