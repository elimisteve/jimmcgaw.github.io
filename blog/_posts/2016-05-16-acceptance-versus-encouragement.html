title: Acceptance Versus Encouragement
---

Here's a tricky question I've been struggling with as of late: when you're deal with another person, what is the correct balance between saying, "As a human being, you are already good enough" and saying, "You have the potential to become much more than you already are"? There's a pernicious insinuation in the latter that, while it may be encouraging, can also be seen as insulting, if it's offered in the wrong situation.<br /><br />When in doubt, I favor acceptance over encouragement. In my experience, people are naturally inclined to grow, to become more than they are, without encouragement. But most people struggle to accept themselves as they are, and you have to start from a place of acceptance before you understand how you can grow.
