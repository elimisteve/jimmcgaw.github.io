title: Intelligence Quotient

In my mind, a person's intelligence has nothing to do with how many facts a person has jammed into their brain, how opinionated they are, or how strongly they cling to those opinions. <br/><br/>It has everything to do with how willing a person is, in light of new evidence or arguments, to consider new facts or opinions that conflict with their own.<br/><br/>You don't have to change your mind. But cognitive biases tend to reinforce prejudice against new ideas. Call it "changeism". If we stigmatize it with an "-ism" word, maybe people will be less inclined to think that way.
