There's a great book I read recently called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159184259X/">Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys To Creativity</a> by Hugh MacLeod. It's a quick read; most of its insights are in the small illustrations (which are the author's craft), which take up roughly half the pages in the book. I picked it up in the bookstore and had finished reading it within 45 minutes. <br /><br />Despite that, I still bought the book, with the intention of re-reading it and then passing it along to a friend. I still haven't been able to bring myself to give it away. It's quite a good book.<br /><br />In one chapter, the Hugh talks about living in the same apartment building as Tim Burton for brief period of time in the late 1980s. They spoke a few times. During one conversation, he asked Tim Burton about pursing a career in the arts. Tim said, "If you have the creative bug, it isn't ever going to go away. I'd just get used to the idea of dealing with it."<br /><br />Good advice, but incomplete: all of us have the creative bug at least part of the time. Some people have it more often than others. It's not an inborn trait in a few rare individuals, but a state of mind that afflicts us when we least expect it. <br /><br />You have the creative bug. And the first step in getting used to it is recognizing it when it strikes.
