title: Digital Liner Notes
---

Song lyrics to your favorite albums are an interesting mess right now.<br /><br />Digital music makes sense to me. But digital booklets accompanying digital music, much less so. I don't understand them. <br /><br />If I google the lyrics to any song, they come up right away, but more often than not, it's a site filled with ads and popups that is trying to sell me ringtones. Means to an end, but an unpleasant one.<br /><br />The liner notes to an LP or CD make sense because they're a physical good and bundling them adds to the experience of an album. They create a connection to the artist. But now, I have the music as MP3s, and if I want to feel connected to the artist, I look them up online.<br /><br />This still feels like an unsolved problem to me. If you're a musician releasing music online, I say that finding a great solution is an opportunity.
