title: Literary Goal
---

In my mind (in other words, this is arbitrary), books fall into three different categories:<br /><br />1. Storytelling - all fiction falls under this umbrella, for example.<br /><br />2. Educational - meant to instruct or teach. Textbooks. <br /><br />3. Ideas - almost all nonfiction is written with this as its currency.<br /><br />In my very limited experience as a reader, the most insightful and interesting books are the ones that manage to achieve a blend of all three of these.
