If you're selling toilet paper to everyone in the world, you probably need to be pretty politically correct. When a Charmin ultra commercial comes on, you're doomed, because the message is going to be watered down, uninteresting, and crafted to speak to the widest possible audience. They want <em>everyone</em> to buy their toilet paper.<br /><br />I'm not convinced this is the correct approach. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9oG49INm4">video created by Lane Bryant</a> that's making fun of Victoria's Secret commercials, and the way a woman is expected to look in general. I think it's a little silly, but it definitely wouldn't be well-received by a mass audience.<br /><br />But there is an audience. Someone is listening and spreading this message, and no wonder...people generally don't clump around what <em>is</em>, but instead around the edges. That's where the interesting people are, and people who are doing interesting work.<br /><br />(Thanks to <a href="http://blog.kiwicreative.net/2010/05/26/victorias-secret-ad-spoof/">Jen</a> for sharing.)
