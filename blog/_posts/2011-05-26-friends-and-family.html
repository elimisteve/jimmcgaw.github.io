title: Friends and Family

Here's my own personal strategy when using social media: I represent myself.<br /><br />That's it. I'm dumb and probably come off as a goofball, but if you're friends with me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter, that's basically what you get: me.<br /><br />I've come across more than one company that asks its employees to use their own personal social media accounts to promote their product or service. I understand the thinking here...if there are large networks of people you can reach through your employees, why not tap into them?<br /><br />There are lots of reasons. I carefully guard my social networks. When I have anyone's attention, whether it's in person or online, I make a very concerted effort not to waste or abuse it. We're all short on time, so I try not to say too much. I'm not one of those people that posts 10 links in a row. Information glut isn't something I feel a need to contribute to.<br /><br />A company that asks me to tell my friends and family about their product or service has a problem, and it's not going to be solved by me telling my friends and family about them. When tapping employee's social networks becomes a core part of the marketing strategy, then it's definitely time to go back to the drawing board. <br /><br />Naturally, if an employee chooses to share something about you of their own volition, that's great. I'm not opposed to that. But if you have to ask them, then that's a desperate plea.<br /><br />I have a friend down in the LA area who opened his own custom body shop and graphics auto shop. He created a Facebook page and asked me to "Like" it. I think it's absolutely great that he started a business, and I'm rooting for him. Honestly, I am. I'd refer anyone I knew in Los Angeles to him if they asked me for a body shop recommendation. But most of the friends I have on Facebook are scattered throughout the country (not in LA), and to my knowledge, <em>none</em> of them are that enthusiastic about their cars. Me clicking "Like" on his page isn't going to have the desired effect. (Assuming, of course, that drumming up more business is his goal.)<br /><br />Marketing is about connecting with people who might be interested in what you're selling. Social media isn't always the answer for everyone.
