title: One Step Away From Money
---

If you're a panhandler, and you're asking people even for just 25 cents, you're going to have a very tough time getting people to give it to you. It's just a quarter...most people have at least one of those in their pocket or purse at any given time, and few of them would miss a quarter. But asking someone to give it to you is still an uphill battle.<br /><br />However, ask someone for a minute of their time to do you a small favor and, provided they're not hurrying back to work after their lunch break, they'll probably help you. Most of us are much more willing to give time than money.<br /><br />As one of my friends once put it: "Money is an energy." People are very funny when it comes to surrendering their cold hard cash, regardless of whether it's for a homeless person or for a local charity.<br /><br />If I were homeless, I would do what author Dan Ariely suggests and panhandle for something that's "one step away from money": gift cards. Ask people if they have unused Starbucks gift cards burning a hole in their pocket. My guess it that people would be willing to part with gift cards than with money, with the added bonus that a homeless person can't generally use a gift card to buy drugs or alcohol.<br /><br />Got any leftover gift cards you don't need?
