title: 'Threat Level: Ambiguous'
---

On the wait to board our airplane in Detroit before flying back to California last month, I overhead an announcement in the terminal:<br/><br/>"The threat level according to [some organization] is: Orange."<br/><br/>I turned to the nearest baggage handler standing by me and asked him what "Threat level: Orange" meant. Trying to avoid eye contact with me, he said that he didn't know and that I would have to talk to someone in TSA to find out.<br/><br/>So, question: how in the hell is anyone supposed to know what "Threat level: Orange" means? A color is not quantifiable in the human mind. "Orange" doesn't even afford a person a sense of where it lies in relation to other colors. Does it use the colors of a rainbow as its range? If so, what's at the top, Red or Violet? It's not even safe to assume that a rainbow is being used here. Maybe they correspond to those delightful Teletubbies, and the orange one was the least threatening.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not going to Google it. Fuck that. If the organizational body (in this case, I presume it's the TSA) that decided upon using colors as a means of setting threat levels wanted to help me as a person, they've failed miserably. You can't expect people to look that kind of information up, since most people don't travel a lot. And even if you do look it up, "Orange" is still unintuitive enough to be useless. There's no mnemonic there.<br/><br/>Let's say you've got five levels you need to specify. Here's what you use: "Safe", "Low", "Medium", "High", and "Everyone's Fucked". Very clear, self-explanatory phrases with semantic meaning for the average human brain. <br/><br/>The engineers that created this system, like so many others, ignored human frailty. Because of this, they've failed to create something useful. (although I might be wrong in assuming that "useful" was the end goal here)
