title: Equality in Right to Marriage
---

I wouldn't have guessed it even five years ago, but we've come to a point where anyone can marry whoever they wish in the United States, regardless of the gender of both parties. I haven't followed the political battle that's been waged over the last decade in getting same-sex marriage legalized. When I was asked about the issue, I plead ignorance, claiming that I simply didn't know enough about the specifics to make an informed judgment.<br /><br />That's still true today, for the most part. (There's one exception: I've studied Christian scripture over the last couple of years, and I'd conclude that marriage between same-sex couples isn't something that's at odds with anything in the New Testament.) I'm still ignorant of the political, economic, and social implications of legalizing same-sex marriage. But the point is that I don't <i>need</i> to be completely informed about every aspect of this issue in order to reach a decision about it.<br /><br />Marriage is a right our society grants to people marrying those of the opposite gender; therefore, it is not a right we should deny to people who marry someone of their own gender.<br /><br />It really is just that simple. You can make the issue more complicated than that, by insisting that homosexuality is a choice and calling into question the ethics of homosexuality itself, or that the drawbacks of it will cause problems in given insurance scenarios, or any number of other things. These are irrelevant. Allowing a freedom to one class of people based on sexual orientation and denying it to another is wrong. As a society, we simply need to do what is right. It's been a long time coming, but I'm happy the United States has.
