title: Redundancies

I received word from a former colleague yesterday that the company I just left about a month ago went through a round of layoffs. While this doesn't come as a complete surprise, that does little to lessen the emotional blow. I know that two people with whom I worked very closely for the past two years, people I greatly respect, got the axe.<br /><br />I decided to take my sabbatical for personal reasons, but I knew it was my time, and I had the resources to do it. I can't be sure how many people were let go. I suspect that many of the people who were let go were caught off guard, and I'm sure some of them have families to support. This is never easy.<br /><br />It was a company full of good people; having to leave the situation was bittersweet. My heart goes out to all of them. I sincerely hope that those who had to be let go find a way forward and land on their feet.
