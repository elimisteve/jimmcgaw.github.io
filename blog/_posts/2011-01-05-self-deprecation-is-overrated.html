title: Self-Deprecation is Overrated
---

Self-deprecation is good as a joke, in small bursts, and when it's meant to be funny. Generally, the best way to put people at ease when they expect that you're about to be full of yourself is to make a joke at your own expense.<br /><br />But it only really works when it's honest. Too often, people will use a self-deprecating remark in an effort to cloak their ego. They willingly take a stab at themselves, but then feel this gives them license to be "right" from that point forward.<br /><br />One reason that I like self-deprecation in small doses is that it has a tendency to increase self-awareness. People are inclined to listen to others who are like them, and with whom they identify. The lead singer of one of my favorite bands often pokes fun not only at himself, but the stereotype that most of his fans embody. <br /><br />This can only be a good thing, since it's hard to get along with other people when you're ignorant of how they perceive you.
