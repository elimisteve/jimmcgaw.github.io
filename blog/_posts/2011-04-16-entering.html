There's one reason that I know my car, apartment, and underworldly possessions are most like safe from theft: they're all very small targets.<br /><br />My car doesn't have a high bluebook value, so it's unlikely anyone will risk driving off with it in the middle of the night. That's protecting it far more than the car alarm is. And I know that my deadbolt is pretty much worthless. A dedicated cat burglar could bypass it without breaking a sweat. But I know that what I keep in my apartment is not worth very much.<br /><br />Security is all about the incentives involved. Provided the security measure adds enough inconvenience or risk to any would-be attacker, as long as it's greater than the potential payoff, it works.<br /><br />I've known people who don't lock their front doors when they leave their homes. You could call them foolish, but they really just don't think that having to carry around a house key is worth the amount of protection they're getting. They figure if someone wants to get into their home and take some things, then that person will find a way to do it, one way or another. If they don't lock their door, at least they won't have the expense of replacing a broken door or window on top of whatever else was taken.<br /><br />It's not just front doors. Do you secure your home wireless network, for example?<br /><br />Overall, I believe that most people are good, honest, and under normal circumstances, don't pose a threat to me or my own personal security. <br /><br />(P.S. Along these lines, any avid users of FourSquare or Twitter should <a href="http://pleaserobme.com/">have a look at this</a>.)
