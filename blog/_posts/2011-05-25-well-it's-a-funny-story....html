title: Well, It's a Funny Story...
---

I was walking through an outdoor shopping mall earlier today when I was stopped by a guy with a rubber bracelet. "Are you interested?" he asked.<br /><br />I looked down at the item in his hand. "What is it?" I asked, since I was curious.<br /><br />Turns out, the answer to that question took about 5 minutes for him to get out, and it included a demonstration involving my participation in order for me to "get it".<br /><br />The product itself involved a good deal of pseudo-science ("Now with snake oil!"), and that's a problem in and of itself, but the bigger problem is that I didn't get it by looking at it. The learning curve for the product was a little bit too steep.<br /><br />For the sales pitch, I'd always favor the simplistic and jejune over the flashy and complicated.
