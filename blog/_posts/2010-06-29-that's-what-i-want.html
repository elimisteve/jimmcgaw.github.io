title: That's What I Want
---

Here's a delightful little story from author Kurt Vonnegut. Unlike most of his delightful stories, he didn't make this one up. It actually happened to him when he was at a party with author Joseph Heller, who wrote a book called <em>Catch-22</em>. The party was hosted by a super-wealthy investor, back when both authors were still alive. The conversation went something like this:<br /><br />Vonnegut: "Joe, how does it make you feel to know that our host only yesterday may have made more money than your novel <em>Catch-22</em> has earned in its entire history?"<br /><br />Heller: "I've got something he can never have." <br /><br />Vonnegut: "What on earth could that be, Joe?" <br /><br />Heller: "The knowledge that I've got enough." <br /><br />In a word: <em>amen</em>.
