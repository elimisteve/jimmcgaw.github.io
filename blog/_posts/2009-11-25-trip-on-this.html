If you're going to start and run your own coffee shop, here's the very first thing you should do before you even start deciding what kind of coffee you're going to serve to your customers: go to the place you're planning to lease and count the outlets. Where are they positioned? Make sure there are at least two plugs per table, and that they're accessible to each table without having to run a lot of cables all over the place. <br/><br/>This is a pain point with a lot of frequenters of coffee shops, particular at peak times when your seating is at capacity and everyone is pounding away on their laptops. It doesn't matter than we're only a few years away from laptops with solid-state drives with long battery lives that don't need to always be plugged in. Take the time, spend the extra money, and make sure customers have easy access to the juice when they need it.<br/><br/>If you're already an established coffee shop, consider closing for the renovation instead of running extension cords all over the place. I'm dead serious. And while we're on the subject, offer free wireless. Password protect it if you must, but none of this "Choose how many hours you want to use it and put in your credit card." If I wanted to pay for wireless Internet access I'd go to Starbucks.
