title: Looking Smart
---

There are two ways to appear smart in the eyes of others:<br /><br />1. Actually know what you're talking about.<br /><br />2. Make the people around you look dumb.<br /><br />I work as computer programmer, I attended middle school and high school, and I'm part of the human race, so I've met my fair share of people who think that #2 is a good shortcut to getting respect. You might win a few people over in the short-term, but eventually, those people will wise up and move on. And those who won't figure it out are not the types of people you should aim to surround yourself with anyway.
