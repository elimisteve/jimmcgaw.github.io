title: Faking Social Proof
---

Early last year, I read an old blog post by a fellow named Clay Shirky. In it he talked about the role of hard liquor during the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Consumption of copious amounts of booze, he says, was an outlet for people's frustrations at the way their lives were changing at the time. <br /><br />He then went on to say that television in America was the 20th century equivalent. As a nation, we ended up with a massive surplus of disposable time after World War II. (Thanks, Grandpa.) Since we didn't know what else to do with all that time, we started watching TV. And we've been doing it pretty steadily for the past 50+ years.<br /><br />The change he claims is happening now involves the Internet. In many ways, the Internet is merely a new way to consume content, albeit in a much more interactive and personalized way. But it also gives a platform to almost anyone who wants to be a producer. And he thinks that people are waking up to this potential they have inside them<br /><br />Mr. Shirky gave a talk about this idea, which you can <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/clay-shirky-on-cognitive-surplus/">watch here</a>. And shortly after I read the post and watched the talk, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532/">book came out</a>.It's a thought-provoking book, and if you enjoy reading about technology's impact in culture or behavior, it's worth a look. <br /><br />I think that what he's talking about is happening to some extent. People who aspire to be artists, filmmakers, or musicians who want to get exposure (or perhaps a financial foothold) have many more opportunities now than they did 20 years ago. And since it's easier, more people are doing it. <br /><br />But I don't think this is quite the movement that he makes it out to be. More people are doing it now than before, yes. But I think the vast majority of people come home from their jobs and spend their evenings watching television. They need something to wash over them and let their brain relax after a hard day's work. There's nothing wrong with this, but this behavior is not fading all that much, and it's not going to disappear anytime soon.<br /><br />And yet, even assuming that Mr. Shirky is wildly exaggerating, I pose the question: who cares if he is? There's tremendous value in social proof. Most people want to do what the people around them are doing, particularly close friends and family. <br /><br />Imagine that you stand up in front of thousands of people and say, "Everyone around you is choosing to express themselves creatively. They're forgoing watching television and making things. They're experimenting, they're starting businesses, they're trying to find their passions." Even if that is stretching the truth, a lot, people will start seeing that in the world around them. They'll notice those friends of theirs who are learning glass blowing or participating in National Novel Writing Month. It brings productive behavior and re-frames it as the norm instead of a anomaly.<br /><br />Truthfully, I don't see the harm in this, because if there's one thing we need now more than ever, it's more initiative. And I'd like to think there's many people that much smarter than me who agree with me.
