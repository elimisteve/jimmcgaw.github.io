title: Find the Coincidentals
---

I often hear someone talk about how they spent their lunch hour at work. "I went to get my tires rotated at this place a few miles away. I always go there because while they're doing it, I go hit golf balls at the driving range next door."<br /><br />That's a happy coincidence, isn't it? While you're waiting for some mechanics to rotate your tires, there's something nearby that you can kill time doing, something you enjoy, that doesn't involve sitting in some small room in uncomfortable chairs with crappy coffee.<br /><br />I hear stories like this all the time. My question: why are they always coincidences? Why is it an accident that these two things are juxtaposed, allowing for convenience, and making people want to talk about where they went to get their tires rotated?<br /><br />Want to find a good business idea? Find two of these coincidentals that people talk about and start a business that puts them together. <br /><br />Why not have an oil change place that has a waiting area with booths where you can practice driving golf balls against a screen? Put a pinball machine in the waiting area so people will have something to do other than just read magazines. You know where I want to get my tires rotated? The place that has the Go-Kart racetrack out back where I can spend my time racing in circles.<br /><br />That puts a spin on it for people with kids, doesn't it? Imagine on a Saturday:<br /><br />Daughter: "Dad, where are we going today?"<br />Dad: "We're going to go get the tires on Daddy's car rotated."<br />Daughter: "Yayyyy!"
