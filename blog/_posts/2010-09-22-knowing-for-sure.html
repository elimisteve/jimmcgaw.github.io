title: Knowing For Sure
---

We all have lots of ideas, about things to do in at our jobs, personal projects we want to start, and life-changing plans. And we question ourselves, asking, "Is this a good idea? Am I sure this is a good idea?"<br /><br />A much better question: "Does anyone in my situation ever know for sure if they have a good idea or not?"<br /><br />If the answer to that question is no, then maybe the merits of the idea don't matter so much. Maybe it's worth the risk of doing it.
