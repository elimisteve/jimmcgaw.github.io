title: Disposable
---

I heard a statistic that said the number of women-owned start-up business ventures outnumbers those started by men by a factor of 7. <br /><br />I'm not sure if this is 100% percent accurate, but it makes sense to me, for one reason: biology. In the animal kingdom, females are the necessary gender for raising and nurturing the young. The males, on the other hand, aren't as critical to the process. Once they've given up their seed, nature gets rid of them (think praying mantises), unless they're needed by the female to help care for the offspring.<br /><br />To my fellow men: this is our lot in life, and we know it. This is the reason that we insist on working at jobs as employees, where our talents and labor are exploited, and when we're used up, we are disposed of. Why do we put up with it? That's what nature has in store for us! <br /><br />Women, on the other hand, have been smart enough to realize that running an industrial manufacturing plant is not the lifestyle they want, so instead of playing the corporate game, a lot of them are running off and trying to create their own game.<br /><br />Creating your own game, with your own rules, is probably the best way to avoid being disposable.
