title: '"Good Morning"'
---

I was hiking in the mountains yesterday morning, and on my way down, I passed a guy on a bicycle who was riding up the trail. Now, riding up this trail is no small feat; it's incredibly taxing. You pedal furiously, and for every twelve pedals your feet put in, you move forward maybe 12 inches.<br /><br />When I'm up hiking during the day, I offer a friendly "Hello" to everyone I pass. Some people give a friendly reply in return and others ignore me completely. But when I pass someone who on a bicycle coming up the trail, I don't say hello to them because they're usually out of breath and fighting just to maintain enough forward momentum to keep from falling over.<br /><br />Yesterday morning, though, this fellow looked up, saw me, and belted out a boisterous and jolly, "Good morning!" I did a double take move, caught off guard by his enthusiasm.<br /><br />A friendly greeting, even in the face of the struggle. Rare, unexpected, and refreshing...three things which have the power to suddenly make our days better.
