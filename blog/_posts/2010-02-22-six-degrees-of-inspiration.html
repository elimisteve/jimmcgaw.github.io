title: Six Degrees of Inspiration
---

A lot of us don't try very hard to make a positive impact on those around us because we don't believe that we hold positions of influence. Let's face it: most of us are not movie stars or very rich.<br /><br />The problem with the Six Degrees of Separation theory is the name. It's actually the Six Degrees of <em>Connection</em>. Think about it. Six degrees of influence, of expressing respect or gratitude, of demonstrating humanity. It means we're, at most, six connections away from someone who's widely respected, or from a person who has influence and is actually in a position to inspire lots of people.<br /><br />Think about the person in this country who inspires you the most. The implication is that you're no more than six connections away from them. That means you have a pretty good chance of returning the favor via your acquaintances or even casual interactions with random strangers, albeit in an indirect way, and without getting credit for it.<br /><br />What you do and how you do it matter a great deal. Share your ideas. Be kinder than you have to. Pay it forward.
