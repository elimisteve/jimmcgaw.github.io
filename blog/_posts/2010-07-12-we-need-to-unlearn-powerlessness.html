title: We Need To Unlearn Powerlessness
---

I was having a conversation about local musicians with a (somewhat older) friend of mine. He was remarking about how talented a lot of street musicians are, and how he hoped that one day, the best of them would be discovered by a talent scout in the recording industry.<br /><br />"Why?" I asked him plainly. "So said record company can take a huge chunk of their earnings for themselves?"<br /><br />He clearly didn't like this set of questions, so I went on to explain that any musician or band in this day and age is perfectly capable of recording, producing, mixing, mastering, and distributing their music without any help from a major record label. He shook his head. "There are still some things a band can't do for themselves, Jim. Marketing, distribution, all of those things require the resources of a big company."<br /><br />If I didn't know any better (and I probably don't), I'd say he almost felt sorry for me for being so naive.<br /><br />Take the band Hawthorne Heights...they're not my favorite musical act by a wide margin, but they are a band that formed, wrote and recorded their music on their own, and developed a fan base using interactions with fans through social media. That's where the marketing and distribution happened, too.<br /><br />It didn't take a lot of money, but it wasn't easy. Building a commercially successful band from nothing involves a lot of sweat equity. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it can be done. In a world where the Internet provides a decent alternative, getting offered a contract from a record label isn't necessarily a ticket to freedom. Just as likely, it could end up putting the band in an artistically constricting situation that isn't nearly worth what it's costing them.<br /><br />Why, then, do so many musicians believe that they need to wait for someone in a suit and tie to validate their work? Is it some form of learned helplessness that parallels Stockholm syndrome?
