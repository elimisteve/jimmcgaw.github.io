In the security field, it really doesn't matter how much you know about security. You can read every book their is on penetration testing, cryptography, or computer cracking. Take in all the theory you want, but it will only take you so far in securing computers networks or organizations from attackers.<br /><br />It's not what you've managed to secure...it's what you've managed to break into.<br /><br />Kevin Mitnick is a highly sought after expert on cracking the human weaknesses in systems, a field called <em>social engineering</em>. He didn't get to that position merely by studying microexpressions or poker tells; he got there by breaking into places. He learned how to infiltrate large organizations and bypass their security by becoming a bullshit artist. (He did spend some time in prison because of this.)<br /><br />It's one thing to learn cautiously and build slowly, but what have you broken?
