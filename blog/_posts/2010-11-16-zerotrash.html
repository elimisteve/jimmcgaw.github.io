Last January, it finally got to me.<br /><br />I live in the downtown area of a relatively small city; it has a lot of the problems that any normal metropolitan area would, but most of them are far less severe than in larger cities. The one that started catching my attention: litter.<br /><br />This was a gradual process...like a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. I kept seeing people's old Starbucks cups and fast food wrappers on the group. There weren't a lot of them, and I realized that it would be pretty easy for one person to make a dent in how much litter is on the streets and sidewalks.<br /><br />And so, I went to a local hardware store, bought a broom and upright dustpan, and started picking up litter. An hour here and there, about once a month.<br /><br />My reason for doing this is selfish: it's good exercise, and I can't stand going to the gym. I've never been much of an environmentalist, but I do live about a mile away from the Pacific, so maybe my actions will keep stuff out of the ocean. (And admittedly, the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> thing has always creeped me out.)<br /><br />For the last few months, I've had a post running on Craigslist telling people what I'm doing, along with an open invitation for anyone to join me if they so pleased. So far, I've had no takers, a fact by which I'm neither surprised nor disappointed...more for me.<br /><br />I discovered yesterday that this wasn't my idea; about three years ago, a guy named Chip McDermott started doing it up in Laguna. Up there, it's a full blown grassroots movement to keep the streets free of litter, and a whole non-profit organization called <a href="http://biz93.inmotionhosting.com/~zerotr5/">ZeroTrash</a> has been started around the efforts of many. It's happening in LA and in San Diego, too.<br /><br />So, I've decided to start calling myself ZeroTrash Santa Barbara, and I started a <a href="http://zerotrashsantabarbara.blogspot.com/">blog</a> (the 20th one I've started this year, I think) and a Facebook page. I didn't get the permission of the official ZeroTrash organization, so we'll see how they react once they find out I'm using their name.<br /><br />I'm hopeful this changes things. Maybe people will have an easier time pitching in to help an organization with a social media presence, instead of just some anonymous guy on Craigslist claiming he's picking up garbage.
