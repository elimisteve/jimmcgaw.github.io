title: Turning Friends into Leads
---

Shortly after graduating from college, I got a rather unexpected call from an acquaintance with whom I went to high school and attended college. (We were both business majors, so we shared a few classes.) After some small talk and kicking around the idea of meeting up for a beer one night, I found myself wondering why he was bothering to call me. We hadn't spoken much in college, and weren't particularly good friends. Why the sudden interest in what I was doing?<br /><br />That was when he mentioned that he was now working at a company where he was in training to be a financial planner. Tactfully, he slipped in a request that I come over to visit him one evening so he and his associates at the company could make a pitch so I might be convinced to let them handle my finances. Ah...now I get it.<br /><br />Here's the problem: if you treat me like a prospect, then I'm going to treat you like a salesman. Actually, I'm going to treat you worse than a salesman, because usually, when I'm talking to a salesman, it's because I've sought them out for something I need. Getting a call from a friend/acquaintance/family member who is trying to sell you something is an <em>egregious</em> violation of trust. It makes you seem more promiscuous and it ruins our relationship by turning it into more of a transaction than a real connection.<br /><br />Facebook is full of people trying to promote things. I'm not against that in and of itself, but I think there's a line that needs to be drawn. Take this blog, for example, which I recently started feeding into my Facebook account so friends would see my posts in their news feeds. I don't have any ads on here, and I never will. I'm here to offer any advice and ideas to anyone that might be interested, not turn it into a profit center.
