title: It's All Wonderland
---

As she delves deeper and deeper into Wonderland, Alice remarks: "Curiouser and curiouser..." Given a reality she didn't fully understand, under circumstances that were somewhat confusing, she started paying attention to the world around her.<br /><br />I drive my car a few times a week, but I've long since stopped wondering what's happening beneath the hood. I take it for granted that there's a complex machine at work, right in my own hands. I don't need to be curious about it until my check engine light comes on. It my ego's way of saving face.<br /><br />Our world is wonderland too, but our brains have long since tricked us into thinking that we've got it all figured out.
