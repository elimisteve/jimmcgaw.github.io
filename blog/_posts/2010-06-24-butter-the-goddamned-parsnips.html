title: Butter the Goddamned Parsnips
---

There's an old expression that reads: "Fine words butter no parsnips."<br /><br />Aerosmith say it in a different way when they sing, "Talk is cheap, shut up and dance."<br /><br />Most people I know (myself included) have a tendency to stall by talking. Instead of doing something, for fear that anything we do will be criticized or ridiculed, we agonize over the "what if...?"s. And that's why procrastination, why talking ideas to death instead of implementing them, is so contagious: because talking usually begets more talking, not action. When you become defensive instead of ignoring the critic and moving forward, you become them.<br /><br />My best advice: go butter your proverbial parsnips, right now, no excuses. Fine words, indeed...why are you still reading this?
