title: You Have Something Worth Selling
---

You have something that other people would buy from you.<br/><br/>I'm sure of it. I don't know what it is, because I can't be sure who you are and I may not know you personally. But I think everyone has something, whether it's an idea, art, or skill, that others want and would gladly pay you for. <br/><br/>Maybe it's not for everyone. Maybe it's only five people, or five hundred, or five thousand who are willing to pay for what you've got. But rest assured, they're out there.<br/><br/>The challenge doesn't lie in coming up with an idea and producing something great from it. The challenge lies in reaching those five people for the first time so that they know who you are. It's in the production of those first five units. It's in shipping those five units to people.<br/><br/>Do you have a book to publish and sell to people? Time was, you needed to convince a major publisher that your book was worthwhile enough to print several hundred copies and spend the money to distribute it. Now, you can go on <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">lulu.com</a> and self-publish with a far lower initial investment. You get an ISBN, they print copies as they are ordered, and help with distribution on Amazon.com. More importantly, you keep most of the profits.<br/><br/>Big ideas are more attractive because they seem more cost effective. Traditionally, finding those first five people was an expensive process, and you probably couldn't make a lot of money producing something for only five people. That's still true, but with the Internet, finding those five people just got easier.<br/><br/>And you never know until you try. It might be more than five. It may be five thousand people. Or even five <em>hundred</em> thousand.<br/><br/>So, let me ask you: what do you have to sell me?
