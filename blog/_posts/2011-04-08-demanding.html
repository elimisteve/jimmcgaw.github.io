A statistic that I've heard a few places: if all Americans started eating the alloted daily recommended quantities of fruits and vegetables every day, our agricultural system does not currently have enough land allocated to fruits and vegetables to meet the demand. (I can't verify if that's actually true, but I'm inclined to believe it.)<br /><br />Reputedly, Wal-Mart is a leader in stocking their stores with organic produce. They did this because their customers asked for it. Because Wal-Mart is a company that holds a tremendous amount of bargaining power with their suppliers, they were able to get organic produce for cheap. And several of their competitors who also stock produce decided to follow suit, partly because Wal-Mart brought the cost of fruit down and because it raised the bar for customer expectations.<br /><br />I'm not a pure libertarian, because I don't think a free-for-all market for businesses is always a good idea. But if you happen to believe in less government, I think you should be writing letters to businesses in lieu of your representatives.
