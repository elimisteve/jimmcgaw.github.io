title: Good Writing is Numbered Dots
---

Here's my favorite piece of writing advice that I've ever heard:<br /><br />"Give the audience one and one, let them make two, and they'll love you for it forever."<br /><br />As writers, we're advised to avoid tautologies. This goes one step further. We shouldn't just avoid saying the same thing twice. We should leave out pieces of information, gaps that the reader must fill in with their own understanding.<br /><br />(I should point out that I've never studied writing; I just play a writer on the Internet.)
