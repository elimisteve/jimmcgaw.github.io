One of my neighbors in the apartment complex where I live is the executive director and founder of this non-profit organization. It's a small music studio in the local Boys and Girls club, where middle and high school students can go after school to get free lessons and use the equipment to record music. <br /><br />The community has been generous; lots of local musicians have donated their time to tutor students, and several people have donated computer equipment and instruments to make the studio comparable to a professional, for-profit recording studio.<br /><br />I asked my neighbor about how he came to found the organization before its humble beginnings. He shrugged, smiled, and told me that he had maxed out a few credit cards to get it off the ground (which he's still paying off). Even now, he works at the studio during his days, and spends his evenings valeting at a local restaurant in order to pay his bills.<br /><br />All so he can give grade-school kids the means to record their music.<br /><br />I can almost guarantee that this wasn't part of his original plan. And this course of action certainly didn't come to him from an aptitude test he took while in high school, or at the behest of a guidance counselor. He had an inclination, and he leaned into it, without knowing exactly what would happen or whether it would work out.<br /><br />So far, from what he tells me, he's making it work. And he's just the kind of protagonist you want to root for.
