title: Strategic Listening
---

Saw the new movie <em>Limitless</em> yesterday. Not a bad little flick, but it's not the first movie I've seen with a miracle cure that turns an unmotivated dolt into a super-confident genius. These movies always have one thing in common: the protagonist becomes a big talker. Given their newfound knowledge, they start talking the ears off of everyone around them. And because they're so smart (presumably), there is no shortage of people standing around to listen.<br /><br />Not sure this is actually how it goes. The smarter someone gets, the more inclined they are to listen, and to listen well, at that. I'm still astonished that I went through four years of high school and four years of college and never, not once during that time, did I ever have to sit through a class that taught Strategic Learning 101.<br /><br />This is a prerequisite for everything...<em>everything</em>...in life. That we aren't formally taught it at any point in our academic lives is beyond reproach.
