It seems that initiation is not so much about internally developing a vision of something over a long period of time, and then persuading people to think you're right.<br /><br />It's more like standing up and announcing to a sea of cubicles, "Hey, I'm going to get Middle Eastern food for lunch. Anyone else want to join me?"<br /><br />It's standing up, saying something, and seeing if anyone else follows you.<br /><br />(The analogy is even more realistic if you imagine that half of the people you're asking have already told you they hate Middle Eastern food.)
