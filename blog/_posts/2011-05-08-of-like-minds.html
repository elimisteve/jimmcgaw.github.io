Mirror neurons are serious business.<br /><br />At least, that's the way you <em>should</em> be looking at it. Hanging out with boring, dull, predictable people who are unable to shut up for more than 10 seconds might be annoying, and it isn't likely to cause you to instantly act like them, but...<br /><br />...but over time, though, you do absorb the qualities of the company that you keep. <br /><br />This is an immensely important piece of information, because we all care a great deal about how we come off to others. Since this is weighted so heavily on the people we associate with, this small tidbit of social psychology should guide every major life decision we make. (Career, personal network, friends, mate.)<br /><br />It probably means that first impression, that "vibe" we get from people before we let our heads get in the way, is something that we should be paying attention to. More importantly, probably wouldn't hurt to work <em>religiously</em> on the first impression you give off.
