title: A Young Man's Fancy
---

According to the old adage, springtime brings about a natural inclination in minds of young men to start chasing skirts. Supposedly, something in the air just makes males more likely to venture out on the prowl.<br /><br />I wonder if this natural drive manifests itself in other ways? Are men more likely to start looking for new jobs when spring rolls around? That information might be useful to headhunters and recruiting firms. <br /><br />I've never paid any attention to how much my own level of initiative goes up during the springtime. For those of us that are already in relationships, I wonder if this is the time to pursue new ideas or dreams? If I'm right, then I should have an easier time convincing people around me to take risks right along with me.<br /><br />Time to get to work.
