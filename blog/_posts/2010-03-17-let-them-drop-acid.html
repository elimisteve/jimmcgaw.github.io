title: Let Them Drop Acid
---

When you think about it, the Beatles were basically the "boy band" of the 1960s. It didn't really get interesting until they started dropping acid and doing heavy drugs, which led to "Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and beyond.<br /><br />So, here's an idea: take Justin Timberlake, the Jonas Brothers, and Hannah Montana, put them into a studio for six months, and make them take drugs. LSD, crack, heroine, cocaine, and all the booze they can drink. Give them a producer who has an uncanny knack for breaking barriers to help them out. As musicians, let's see what they're all really capable of creating.<br /><br />One of two things will come from this drug- and alcohol-fueled session:<br /><br />1. We'll get some good music out of these musicians for a change, or<br /><br />2. We'll get terrible, obnoxious, unlistenable auditory garbage. This will help dispel the widely held, but mistaken, myth that drugs and alcohol are somehow a prerequisite to creating good music.<br /><br />My money is on the latter happening. And I guarantee that any publicity surrounding the event would be much more effective at discouraging kids from doing drugs than any one thing that D.A.R.E. ever did.
