title: Order Out of Chaos
---

The Internet is a mess. There's value in its content, but in order to get at it, you need to wade through a ton of junk first. <br /><br />Successful web companies help users make order out of chaos. Google did it by making sites with more inbound links rank higher in search results. If you link to a site on your web page, it's as if you're casting a vote for that site to rank higher. (It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the idea.)<br /><br />Same with social bookmarking sites like Delicious and Digg. People bookmark their favorite sites, tag them with words, and then others can find them when they search for those words.<br /><br />Technorati is a site that indexes and organizes the content of blogs on the Internet. It helps people searching for content in blogs find the more popular posts.<br /><br />Want to start a successful web company? Help Internet users make order out of chaos. Organize. Create a way for valuable content to bubble to the surface so users can easily find it. How would you do that?<br /><br />Furthermore, most of the existing examples are based on a system of votes or popularity. Could you create a system that wasn't based on that means of ordering?
