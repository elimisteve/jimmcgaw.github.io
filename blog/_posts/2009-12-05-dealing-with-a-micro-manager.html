title: Dealing with a Micro-Manager
---

So what if you're dealing with someone that won't let you just do your job the way you see fit? What if you have a boss that's constantly butting in to check up on how you're doing, and giving you pointers about how you should be doing your tasks?<br/><br/>Here's how you take the offensive: ask a ton of clarifying questions about every little detail. And I mean a ton. Dozens and dozens each day. Don't wait for them to come over and bother you. Go bother them, in their office, with lots of serious and thoughtful questions.<br/><br/>Remember the carpenter on <em>Seinfeld</em> who was hired to re-design Jerry's kitchen? He drove Jerry insane asking about every little detail. If you're being micro-managed, your homework assignment is to watch that episode (along with several others to de-stress yourself) and then go into work tomorrow ready to act like that guy. Well-meaning but annoying.<br/><br/>If nothing else, take consolation in the fact that the micro-manager is mostly responsible if you screw something up.
