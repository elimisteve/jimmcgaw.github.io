TED is a large conference where lots of the best, brightest, or at least the most notorious, minds in the world gather in order to present interesting ideas to a large audience. It costs a lot of money to attend and more to be a speaker. For the rest of us, there's a massive online video archive that we all can watch for free.<br /><br />Most of my close friends already know about TED, but to my "weak ties" out there: I'd encourage you to dip into their online archive and listen to a few. At their worst, they can be pedantic, but at their best, they're extremely inspirational and make you see the world a different way. All of them are guaranteed to teach you something.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorites; you mileage may vary:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html">The Child-Driven Education</a> - Ten years ago, a researcher puts a computer with the Internet in a wall in a city in India otherwise devoid of technology. The kids figure out how to use the computer (without any instructions) and teach themselves more than I've probably forgotten from first grade.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html">When Ideas Have Sex</a> - <em>Genome</em> author Matt Ridley talks about how members of society combine their ideas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html">J.J. Abrams and the Mystery Box</a> - "Sometimes mystery is more important than knowledge." It's a few years old, but still worth a watch. Based on what he says, <em>nobody</em> should have been surprised that "Lost" ended with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Go, now, fan them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TED">Facebook</a>...it's a worthwhile addition to your News Feed.
