I mentioned to my friend Greg that I was trying to learn how to draw better. He gave me a very good piece of advice: don't worry about drawing better. Just draw more.<br /><br />There's a chasm between the luck and drive of a beginner, and the skill and finesse of an expert. Somewhere in this gap, there's a frustration that stems from knowing you can or should do better before you're fully capable. It's demotivating...and it's one of the main things that separates serious workers from the tourists.<br /><br />We're always creating the hindsight. The past we can look upon and recognize how much better we've gotten. The more there is, the better.
