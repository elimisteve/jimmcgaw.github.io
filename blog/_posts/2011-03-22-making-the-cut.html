After bassist Cliff Burton of Metallica died back in the 1980s, the rest of the band started holding auditions for his replacement. One of the people who auditioned was a guy by the name of Les Claypool.<br /><br />Les Claypool is the lead singer and bassist (how often do those two things go together?) of a band called Primus. In terms of alt-rock bands of the 1990's, Primus achieved a great deal of success. Every rock bassist I've ever met in my age range absolutely worships the ground that Les walks on; they look up him both as a musician and an innovator.<br /><br />And yet Metallica didn't hire him. By their own admission, it was because he was "too weird". They just didn't think his style of playing was a good fit for their band. And undeniably, it had <em>nothing</em> to do with Les' lack of talent, because it abounds in his music.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind next time you get a rejection letter from a prospective employer.
