title: The Sand
---

There is a story that has come to my attention from several different people. (It takes place in Texas, and I don't know a soul in Texas.) Quick question: what do you do when you're running a movie theater, and ticket sales have been falling? <br /><br />The answer is likely "better marketing". And how do you do that? By taking a stand. By drawing a line in the sand. And that might involve <a href="http://cf.drafthouse.com/she_texted_we_kicked_her_out2.html">publicly firing some of your worst customers</a>.<br /><br />They might take it personally. Let them. It's called "positioning" for a reason, and people have been doing it for decades because it works if you do it right.
