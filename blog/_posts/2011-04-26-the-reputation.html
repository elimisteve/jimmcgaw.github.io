title: The Reputation
---

There's one aspect of the art community that's sorely lacking from other industries, and it's the reputation of the master.<br /><br />Was walking down the street with a friend of mine the other day, and he said, "Over here, behind this building, there's a painting on the wall. I'm pretty sure it's a Banksy."<br /><br />You hear this in art museums all the time. People refer to the work of an artist as a singular piece of them. ("A Picasso." "A Rembrandt.") It's the mark of an accomplished artist with a distinctive style that's instantly recognizable. <br /><br />You don't hear people say that sort of thing about video games. Or craft jewelry being sold on Etsy. Or children's toys. Consumer goods are typically branded by a company name instead of the name of the individual.<br /><br />Since we live in an era when anyone can own the means of production (all you need is a laptop), it makes a lot of sense to strive to make your own work referred to as "a [your name]".
