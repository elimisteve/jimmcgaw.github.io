title: Street Benefit Concert
---

I like it when a big name band puts on a benefit concert, where multitudes of fans pay to see a live performance by their favorite band, but the band donates all of the proceeds to a charity of its choice. U2 is probably the biggest name that comes to mind as having done something like this.<br /><br />This idea, as simple as it is, doesn't have to be exclusive to more well-known artists. You might not be able to fill a stadium, but if you and a few friends have some musical chops, why not hit the streets and put on your own little "benefit concert" right on the sidewalk? Bring a lockbox and put a sign on it with the logo of the charity of your choice.<br /><br />The Salvation Army has Santa Claus ringing a bell outside stores at Christmastime. That's not musical; it's actually kind of annoying, but there's little else those poor guys can do standing out in the cold like that. Think Christmas in July, when it's warm enough to bring instruments.
