title: Will You Let Me Know?
---

Restaurants that take reservations have always had problems with no-shows. And on busy nights, when you have a lot of walk-ins, and you're juggling people showing up late for reservations or not at all, then it becomes a terrible headache to manage.<br /><br />So how do you make sure that people will let you know they're going to cancel their reservation instead of just abandoning it? Simple: ask.<br /><br />A study found that, after booking each reservation, if the hostess asked the caller, "If you need to cancel, will you please call us and let us know?" Just securing a simple "yes" to that question reduced the number of people who flaked out on their reservations. It's a small commitment, and getting people to verbally agree to it makes them feel obligated to follow through, one way or the other.<br /><br />We don't all work in restaurants or take reservations, but when was the last time someone didn't show up for an appointment with you?
