title: Keeping Secrets
---

If you have an idea that you're going to spend a lot of time working on, do you tell people about it or keep it a secret? Like most of us, I have lots of ideas, a handful of which I make an effort to follow through on. I'm still undecided on the best approach.<br /><br />Secrecy has its merits. I'm usually not worried about someone stealing my ideas, because in my experience, most people don't do that and ideas are, by themselves, plentiful. It's a different reason for me: if I keep something a secret, it creates this itch inside of me to get it finished and get it out the door. I'm always afraid that if I start to discuss an idea that I'll end up talking the idea to death. Making myself keep it secret, until after it's done, is a way of dangling a carrot in front of myself. I keep myself motivated with the satisfaction of telling people about, but only <em>after</em> the fact.<br /><br />And yet, there's little to match what happens when you bounce ideas off of other people. If you have a good idea, and you tell everyone you know about it, chances are their reactions are going to be immensely helpful to you in shaping or refining the idea, usually in a way that makes it better.<br /><br />I'm torn about this, but I am curious if any other creative types (that would be you, whoever you might be) have given this any thought. Do you keep things secret or not?
