title: One for the History Books
---

I'm not actually one for watching a lot of news. The breaking headlines about the situation in Egypt didn't interest me at all in the beginning, when the revolution first started. As soon as I caught wind of Mubarak stepping down, however, I immediately had to read about the revolution and what had happened.<br /><br />I like news as soon as it becomes history, when the story we're hearing about reaches its conclusion. I guess I don't fancy an unresolved narrative; I don't enjoy the speculative conversations in which people talk at length about what "could happen". Tell me when things wrap up, and then I can draw my lessons about life from what transpired.<br /><br />This might be a large part of the reason I'm not inclined towards politics, but am fascinated by history. And it's difficult for me to say exactly when the former becomes the latter.
