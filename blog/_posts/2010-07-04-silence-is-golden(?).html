title: Silence is Golden(?)
---

I recently went looking for computer keyboard that was completely silent. At home, my computer is in the same room as our television, so my girlfriend is stuck with the incessant clickety-click of my fingers pounding the keys. I decided to get a silent keyboard so she wouldn't have to suffer the noise pollution.<br /><br />There are keyboards that are flexible and made of rubbery material that roll up, but those keyboards aren't that great, and they just happen to be much quieter. After playing around on New Egg for a while, I asked around to see if anyone had ever heard of such a thing.<br /><br />To my surprise, I couldn't find a computer keyboard that had "silent" as one of its selling points. I imagine the reason for this is that a silent keyboard (or a silent mouse, for that matter) has never been a "buying point" for people in the market for computer supplies. When I asked some tech-savvy people about it, I asked them why they thought computer keyboards and mice should make any noise at all; in my mind, the tactile response is enough for most people to know they've clicked the button.<br /><br />It's one of those things that we've never given a second thought. Mice click, make noise, and that sound is the bane of the existence of cubicle workers everywhere. I'm hopeful Logitech will address this problem soon.
