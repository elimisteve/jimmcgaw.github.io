title: Why Learn Math?
---

Jesus must have been a difficult fellow with whom to have a conversation. In the gospels' accounts of Him, He responds to questions with parables about goats and vineyards and bridegrooms. I can only imagine the circuitous answer I might get from Him if He were the concierge at a hotel and I was urgently looking for the bathroom. Blessed is he who wets his pants waiting for the Lord to get to the point.<br /><br />His disciples asked him why he spoke in riddles to people. In His own defense, Jesus said this about why he spoke in parables: "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables, so that seeing, they may not see, and hearing, they may not hear." (Luke 8:10)<br /><br />Galileo wrote about 1500 years later: "Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe."<br /><br />And yet many of us still ask why Nature has chosen to reveal herself to us in the confounding and convoluted language of mathematics.
