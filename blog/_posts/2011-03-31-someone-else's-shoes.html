title: Someone Else's Shoes
---

Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that one attribute of good writing is that it lets you see the world through someone else's eyes. It lets you walk a mile in their circumstance and start to understand things as they understand them. <br /><br />This is the power of story. You can say things without saying them.<br /><br />In all this, there lies an opportunity for those who are teaching English classes. That's the lesson we can learn from books we're forced to read in high school: <em>empathy</em>. <br /><br />Much harder to teach, and much harder to evaluate with a standardized test, but I think it's far more important than focusing on themes, foreshadowing, and onomatopoeia.
