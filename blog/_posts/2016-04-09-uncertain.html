The question occurs to me more often on days when I'm immersed in an environment of younger people. Amongst high schoolers and college students, talking about their passions and the marks they intend to leave on the world, my perspective on myself comes into focus, and I see that I'm markedly different than most of them.<div><br /></div><div>In getting a little older, I haven't lost my enthusiasm for life; this happens to a lot of people as the years wear on, and I'm happy I've avoided this fate thus far. I only need to look at the wide world around me to revitalize that sense of limitless possibilities. But I'm in contrast with many people, especially the younger ones, and this merely make me wonder: do I actually miss being that sure of myself?</div>
