title: Tell Her About It
---

What if maybe...just maybe...today is the day.<br /><br />You have an idea that you've been chewing on. Maybe it's a business idea, maybe it's a screenplay you want to write, maybe you've decided that covering an entire city building in glitter-and-glue macaroni would be a good art project.<br /><br />And another thing: you've been keeping it a secret for a while.<br /><br />You don't actually want to tell anyone about it because you're afraid others won't like the idea. Or maybe you want to keep it secret because that motivates you. Or perhaps it's because you're afraid someone else will steal it and do it before you.<br /><br />Go, right now, and tell someone. A few things might come from this:<br /><br />1. Maybe your idea changes. Talking things out activates other parts of your brain than merely thinking does.<br /><br />2. Maybe the person offers good feedback. Maybe it's constructive, something you needed to hear. Maybe it adds to the idea.<br /><br />3. Maybe the person offers terrible feedback. At least you know you're better off going it alone for the time being.<br /><br />Hearing yourself describe something out loud, to another person who's listening, is incomparable to anything else. Even if it just results in an internal monologue, it's the best way to determine if you're really on to something.
