title: Movements Don't Begin With a Leader
---

They start with the first person who chooses to stand up and follow that leader. Until that happens, there is no movement, just a person with an idea, and without followers, they're not a leader.<br /><br />A lot of us are sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike, for that perfect idea to champion, so we can stand up and start leading people. We're waiting for that "dare to be great" opportunity to cross our paths, so we can go down in history as the PERSON WHO DID THAT HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT THING.<br /><br />We all know the name Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and while he accomplished a great deal as a leader, I'd be hard-pressed to accept the notion that he did it on his own. He undoubtedly had help and support from a great many people under him, who were following his direction and pitching in when it came to the details. <br /><br />And while this sounds less appealing in theory, really good followers have initiative, which makes them leaders in their own right. Think of them as sub-leaders. And spending time in that role, anywhere, is a much better way to learn how to lead than sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike.
