title: Nothing (and Everything) to Lose
---

I realized this morning as I was furiously pounding away on the code for a personal project that I'm in the very fortunate position of not having anything to lose. I'm an individual, flying by night, and since the work I do on my own time doesn't bring in money I depend on, I can push the envelope, break things, and the consequences are minimal because I have nothing to lose.<br /><br />Contrast that with an established tech company where things have been pretty much the same for the past five years, and everyone is afraid to change things, lest the effect of a small change ripple and cause negative repercussions. These situations exist where stability seems real, and <br /><br />And yet, I don't think the strategy should vary much between the company with nothing to lose and the company with everything to lose. The goal for both is simple: stay in motion. Don't stop, and don't stagnate. I think that's especially true if you're an established company, because sooner or later the world is going to pass you by. And if you're not moving, you're going to miss it.<br /><br />The more you have to lose, the more you should probably be acting as though you have nothing to lose.
