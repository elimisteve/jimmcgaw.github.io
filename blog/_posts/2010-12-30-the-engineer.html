They did a study a few years back. Here's the gimmick: they created a lab where people could do searches on Yahoo!, and searches on Google, but the results from both were switched. The Google results page was actually display results from Yahoo!, formatted to look like Google results, and vice versa. The question was posed: which gave you better results?<br /><br />The answer was about what you would expect. Now, if you visit the Googleplex and ask Larry Page about why he has a better search engine, he's going to tell you it's because he writes code and he's brilliant. Which he is, don't get me wrong...but that answer is incomplete.<br /><br />I've met people who regret not getting more education, e.g. not studying computer science, because they think the opportunity to build something great has slipped by them. I don't agree with this. Education is better than no education, and you can't get away with being a surgeon without learning the ropes, but I don't think a lack of education should stop anyone from trying things.
