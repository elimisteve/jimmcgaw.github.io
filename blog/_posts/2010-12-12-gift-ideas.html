title: Gift Ideas
---

I was brainstorming recently about how to create a gift idea engine for people trying to determine what to get their friends and relatives for Christmas. After a bit of Googling, I found Amazon's Facebook app, which generates gift recommendations for each of your friends on Facebook based on their profile info.<br /><br />Less than two weeks to go, I thought I'd share the link. Find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore">here</a>...in the column at the far right, there's a button that reads "Tap into Your Facebook Network". Click that to get started.<br /><br />You probably shouldn't use it to shop for your girlfriend, but for those distant relatives, it might spit out some useful ideas.
