title: To People Who Hate Twitter
---

When I was a teenager, I used to listen to a lot of Bob Dylan. Not because he can sing well, but for everything else. I'd like to open my book of Dylan and recite a page from "The Times They Are A-Changin'":<br/><br/>"Come mothers and fathers throughout the land,<br/>And don't criticize what you can't understand."<br/><br/>As my generation slowly leaves the realm of young adulthood and enters the age of being parents, I'm surprised at how many of my peers are failing to adapt to new things. Several of my friends have denounced Twitter as being "stupid" and "pointless" simply because they don't understand the value in it. (Most of these people were saying the same thing about Facebook and MySpace when they launched five years ago; now most of those people use them.)<br/><br/>You know what's funny? I'm in my twenties and I know lots of people my own age who are already "grumpy old men". Give them 40 or 50 years and they'll turn into the curmudgeons sitting in diners eating soup and whining about "these young people today". Chances are good these grumpy old people didn't acquire their distaste for youth over time. More likely, they were sitting around complaining about people even when they were young, in the prime of their lives.<br/><br/>Youth is wasted on the young. [sigh]
