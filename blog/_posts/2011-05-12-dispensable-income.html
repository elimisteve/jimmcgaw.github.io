title: Dispensable Income
---

After paying for taxes, rent, food, and other necessities of life, the money you have left to spend is often referred to as "disposable income".<br /><br />The insinuation of this widely pervasive phrase is simple: that you should dispose of it. This smacks of an inclination to be a consumer: go down to the Sharper Image and buy the vibrating pad for a chair that massages your butt.<br /><br />I have no problem with electric butt massagers, but it seems like we could change the phrase to set people's ambitions a little higher. "Savable income", perhaps? Or maybe "dispensable income", implying that it could be allocated to parts of society where it's sorely needed.<br /><br />Words are small, but they can have a massive impact.
