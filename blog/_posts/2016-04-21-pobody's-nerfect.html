Being the complete and total geek that I am, I always carry pens with me in the front pockets of my jeans. Sooner or later, the cap comes off of one of them and the front of my jeans gets stained with blobs of ink.<br /><br />Despite this, I continue to wear the jeans. Sure, I <i>could</i>&nbsp;replace them, but if I'm meeting someone new for the first time, and they're sizing me up, I think having the blobs of ink stains on the front of my jeans accurately reflects the kind of person I am.
