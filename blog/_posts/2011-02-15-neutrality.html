title: Neutrality
---

Someone asked Jimmy Wales about the neutrality of any given Wikipedia article. Historically, <em>neutrality</em> is a loaded term that has been debated about at length, as a philosophical concept. What makes an idea neutral? Can an idea be neutral, given that any thought or idea is invariably born of at least (or at most) one human mind?<br /><br />Wales was dismissive of the question, saying that philosophical debates really didn't interest him. He went on further to say that a Wikipedia article is "neutral" as soon as people stop editing it.<br /><br />This is simple enough: anyone can edit a Wikipedia entry, so as articles get refined over time, any ambiguities in language that leave room for dispute are ironed out of the content. Neutrality, then, becomes something that happens in a social context, when no one feels obliged to voice protest.<br /><br />Even then, there's no such thing as something purely neutral. It's more of a quiet truce than it is agreement. And yesterday's neutral often becomes the catalyst of tomorrow's revolution.
