In the film <i>Almost Famous</i>, Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays a fictionalized version of the American music journalist Lester Bangs. The film centers on a teenaged kid traveling with a popular rock band, and he's an aspiring music journalist himself. Towards the end of the film, Bangs' character is giving his protégé some advice, hoping to give him context for a problem he's facing.<br /><br />In his monologue, he offers, "We are uncool. Women will <i>always</i> be a problem for guys like us."<br /><br />This past summer, I attended a large festival in southern France. This event draws tens of thousands of people who crowd the streets of a relatively small town. I was there with a group of a few dozen people, as a lone American amidst the native French.<br /><br />One of my friends is a guy who is much better looking than I am. I can say this with complete confidence in my own heterosexuality. It's simply an objective fact I can state, without being self-deprecating. Not only are his physical features are more striking, but he carries himself with more confidence and charisma than I do.<br /><br />At this festival, I was standing amidst the dense crowd when a girl came wandering by my cluster of friends. It didn't seem she wasn't headed anywhere in particular; she was just making her way through the throng from some A to some other B. She passed by on my left. In scanning the crowd, her eyes suddenly lit upon my friend, standing a few meters to my right.<br /><br />I'll never forget the way her eyes widened and her jaw dropped. "Oh my god!" she exclaimed, and almost instinctively, she suddenly moved with purpose, making a beeline for my friend. In the process, she nudged me and the person I was talking to out of her way, so she could pass between us. It was a busy evening, and while I have no idea what happened when she approached my friend, I'd guess that he got away from her pretty quickly.<br /><br />To the best of my knowledge, no girl has ever reacted to me this way, drawn lustfully toward me based on a mere first impression. In my youth I would have felt jealous of my friend. At the time this happened, though, I felt the complete opposite of envy. I remember thinking, <i>Better him than me</i>. I had a girlfriend at the time, and while this was pretty much the only factor that drove my thoughts, I could still appreciate not having to expend any energy to identify and ward off the capricious.<br /><br />I identify with the group of guys that Lester Bangs places himself into. While I'm not a bad-looking guy (*adjusts tie*), I am uncool. But he has it completely backwards. While I understand that what he means is that getting any girl won't ever be an <i>effortless</i> process, I learned long ago that women will&nbsp;never&nbsp;be a <i>problem</i> for guys like me.
