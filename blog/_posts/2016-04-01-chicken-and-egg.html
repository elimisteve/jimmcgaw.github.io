"No one can come to the Father except through me." -Jesus, John 14:6<br /><br />"No one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them." -Jesus, John 6:65<br /><br />Christian scripture gives us an infinite loop. Next time someone asks me if I've accepted Jesus as my savior, I'll simply quip that I tried once, but it crashed my heart.
