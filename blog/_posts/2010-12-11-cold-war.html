Just over nine years ago, when I was going to Michigan State, the university hosted an ice hockey game between themselves and their biggest rival, the University of Michigan. Instead of hosting it inside of the ice arena, but instead converted their football field into an ice arena and held the game there. As a result, they set the world record for attendance at a hockey game. (The game was called the "Cold War" and about 74,000 people attended.)<br /><br />The record was broken last May in Germany, but the University of Michigan has probably been planning to top Michigan State since the ice melted nine years ago. Today, a game is being held at U of M's "Big House" stadium, and attendance is supposed to break the record at over 100,000 people.<br /><br />This isn't specific to the University of Michigan, but it's typical of organizations: they don't know what to do, or how big to do it, unless they're doing it relative to a competitor.
