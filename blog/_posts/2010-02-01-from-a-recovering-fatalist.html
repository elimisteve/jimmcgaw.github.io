title: From a Recovering Fatalist
---

If I had to describe myself very simply at this point in my life, I'd call myself a "recovering fatalist". I think this is the plight of a lot of people in their mid- to late-twenties. <br/><br/>I spent most of my youth believing that we're all pretty much screwed no matter what we do in life. I still think that a lot of what happens to us is mostly attributable to luck and circumstance, but I'm trying to convince myself that a positive attitude and lots of effort isn't an exercise in futility, and to live that mentality each day. <br/><br/>Trying greatly increases your odds of failing, but it also increases your odds of succeeding.
