The most important criteria for the health of any culture is how tolerant it is of individuality. It must be open to having questions asked, even about its most fundamental principles. It must demonstrate that it doesn't feel threatened when presented with skepticism.<br /><br />People are, by their very nature, curious. This is the most wonderful quality about being a human being; that we seek endlessly to further our understanding of the world around us. The world is complex, and it is simply impossible for any one person to truly grasp all of it. The pursuit of understanding is a Sisyphean task. It comes as little surprise, then, that people tend to fall into patterns of thinking that they accept without question. Adopting a more singular mindset, abandoning curiosity, is a kind of cognitive shortcut.<br /><br />Do I do this? Of course I do. We all do it. I'll give you one example: sometimes there's an issue that comes up in conversation related to issues about prescription medication. Someone mentions that this is a problem with "Big Pharma". I know what they're saying; they're implying that the large pharmaceutical companies are an entrenched interest and they're abusing their power. I know <i>nothing</i>&nbsp;about these debates. I know about several other topics, but I'm completely ignorant of the politics surrounding this specific issue. When it comes up, I make a very conscious decision not to ask any questions, simply because the CPU cycles in my brain are typically all spoken for, and I haven't had a good reason to overclock my brain in order to learn more about this.<br /><br />This is different from what I'm talking about. The conscious choice to remain ignorant of a particular issue, in order to keep focus on the issues that matter most to you, isn't a bad thing. It's simple conservation of energy.
