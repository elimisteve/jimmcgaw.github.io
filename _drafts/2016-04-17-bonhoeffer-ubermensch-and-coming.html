There are extremely few theologians who have written about Christian doctrine that I have any interest in. Over the centuries, the contents of the New Testament, and the entirety of the Holy Bible, have been analyzed to death. Christianity itself fractured the members of the Jewish community at the time of its inception, and ever since then, it has been accumulating mass and dividing itself asexually like some kind of holy amoeba. Most of this division proceeds from such analysis, and the subtle differences that men find when they compare their notes amongst themselves. I find this odd, because there is tremendously little difference in the varying interpretations. St. Augustine, Martin Luther, Johnathan Edwards, and Billy Graham have never offered drastically different points on the same collection of ancient writings; they've merely offered a translation that speaks to their readers in their time and place.<br /><br />When I mention Dietrich Bonhoeffer to most people, they haven't heard of him. Until relatively recently, neither had I. When I first learned about who he was and the life he had led, I was completely surprised to learn that such a man had ever existed, and that, since he <i>had</i> existed, that he'd managed to escape my notice for so long.<br /><br />Nietzsche, another German whose own writings on God (and whose writings take a radically different stance on the matter) preceded Bonhoeffer's by only a few decades, derided those of the faith by writing: "There was only one true Christian, and He died on the cross." As a joke at the expense of human hypocrisy, I laughed uproariously the first time I read that. The religious accounts of Jesus claim that He was a man completely free from sin, the man who lived the absolute perfect life. Despite the claims of Christians that it's a perfection none of us can ever truly achieve, we're all encouraged to attempt to live up to this example. As individuals, we're also <i>discouraged</i> by society from setting ourselves up for failure. Hrm.<br /><br />Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born in Germany, and he entered his teenage years during the course of World War I. Despite being a gifted pianist, he ended up studying theology and becoming a pastor in the Christian church. Like many Germans, he fled the country and came to the United States when Hitler started rising to power.<br /><br />His conscience got the better of him. He returned to Germany in order to continue preaching out against the actions of the Nazi Party, despite knowing that this would almost certainly result in eventual imprisonment and death. He was imprisoned in 1943. Later, it was revealed that he had had a major hand in the July 20th plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He was transferred to a concentration camp. When Hitler learned of the participants behind the assassination plot, he demanded that the individuals be tried and executed immediately. Bonhoeffer was hung just two weeks shy of the Allies liberating the camps.<br /><br />Here was a man who not out preached Christian doctrine, but he actively took a stance against one of the inhumane political movements of the 20th century, at great risk to himself. Christian morality insists that killing is wrong, but he still chose to risk Hitler's blood on his hands. He continued his church outreach during the 2 years he spent in prison, and he went to gallows with no regrets about what he had done.<br /><br />Bonhoeffer is an exemplar of the human beings throughout history who have attempted to live out the life he had learned from the Jesus in scripture. If there is any single example of a theologian in recent memory who might be able to teach me something practical about Christianity, it would almost certainly be Bonhoeffer. In his most famous book, <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i>, he wrote,&nbsp;"When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die." Coming from almost any other writer, these words could be easily dismissed as an academic moral axiom.<br /><br />Bonhoeffer's own work on ethics, the aptly titled&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, details how the Christian individual should apply the moral lessons of scripture to contemporary life.&nbsp;Aristotle's tome on morality, his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, is challenging to parse linguistically, but is conceptually straightforward. By comparison,&nbsp;<i>Ethics </i>is an extremely challenging read. Part of the difficulty in the writing is due to the fact that, unlike Aristotle's work, Bonhoeffer's treatise on morality is specific to the Christian understanding of good and evil based on what's written in the Bible, which is not the easiest book to understand in its own right. Bonhoeffer's ideas in <i>Ethics</i> flow around each other in a kind of elegant dance, seeming to contradict and oppose one another, and yet somehow weaving themselves into a tapestry that, in aggregate, makes sense. (Outside of a Christian understanding, I don't think the book has many practical lessons to offer its readers; and that's a conjecture on my part because I'm not a Christian.)<br /><br />The life of Bonhoeffer is the one reason that the story of Jesus of Nazareth, as recorded in the Gospels, isn't a story I can dismiss outright. It's very easy to escape the notion of living by the principles that Jesus is supposed to have taught, because according to legend, he was a god-man, and as a god-man he was&nbsp;<i>completely incapable</i> of humanity's mistakes. As human beings, then, we are incapable of escaping our own tendency to make these mistakes. If the example of Jesus is unattainable, why bother trying?<br /><br />We can try because of people like Bonhoeffer. He was a human being, just like any of us, and in his time, he strived to fight for a cause that was greater than himself. To be clear, I'm not insisting that a society's sense of right and wrong&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;come from Christianity, or from <i>any</i> religion, for that matter.<br /><br />Of his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler, he admitted later that by participating, he was willingly taking blood on his hands; he felt his own conscience was clean, and left to God whatever judgment he had coming in any supposed hereafter. In&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, he writes this of the individual's responsibility to act in the best interest of the society at large: "The ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live."
