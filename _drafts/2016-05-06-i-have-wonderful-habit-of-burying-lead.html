I have a wonderful habit of burying the lead in my blog posts. I'd like to think that in most of what I write, there is some tiny nugget of wisdom, however small, that the reader can dig out of it. But that bit of wisdom really only gets across if you attempt to establish some context, to give the reader a sense of <i>why</i>&nbsp;and <i>how</i>&nbsp;you've come to that conclusion.<br /><br />Here, Dear Reader, is the moral of this post: failure causes pain, but helplessness causes pain that is far worse.<br /><br />I've written about this story before, so I'm going to keep light on the details here. About three months ago, I flew back to Michigan to meet up with a girl that I knew from college. I was interested in her romantically. My interest was based on<br /><br />I'm not going to try and play this off in any kind of sour grapes sort of way. I suspect, in hindsight, that I misjudged her, that I didn't correctly get a sense of who she really was...so perhaps my feelings of affection were entirely misplaced. But they were real, whether they were appropriate or not. Getting rejected romantically always hurts, regardless of how stoic you want to try and act.<br /><br />Once we actually got together, and I explained to her why I had come to see her, she felt a little wary that I had flown all the way across the country to ask her out on a date without having gotten to know her first. I incorrectly interpreted her wariness as insecurity, so my cutesy attempts to reassure her just made me seem obsessive. In the end, she politely said, "No thanks."<br /><br />The other part of<br /><br />So we're back at the beginning: failure causes pain, but helplessness causes pain that is far worse. Perceived helplessness, and the apathy that stems from it, is more pernicious because it can hide within you in small chunks, drawn out over time, causing hemorrhaging by a thousand cuts. Failure is characteristic of an <i>event</i>; helplessness is characteristic of a <i>person</i>.
