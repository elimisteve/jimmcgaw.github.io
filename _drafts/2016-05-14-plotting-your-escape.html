I've read discussions online about how things are for workers in the retail industry. Very often, I come across someone who says something like, "When you're young, you should work at a retail job. That will give you the incentive to want to go to college."<br /><div><br /></div><div>The no-so-hidden implications here are:</div><div><ol><li>Retail jobs are often pretty terrible environments.</li><li>Going to college and getting a degree gives you the highest probability of avoiding them.</li></ol><div>I don't like the dog-eat-dog mentality that these kinds of comments belie. I have only a small amount of experience working in service industry jobs, but I'd gather from those that having to deal with customers can often be unpleasant. Society tells us to escape from its clutches by getting more educated. If you don't, and you end up working in retail, then you didn't try hard enough. <i>C'est la vie.</i></div></div>
