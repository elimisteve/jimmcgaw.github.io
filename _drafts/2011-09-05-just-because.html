When I was in fourth grade, I remember winters on the playground during elementary school recess in Southfield, MI. I vividly recall large snow banks that were as tall as I was, along the edges where the concrete met the grass, as a result of snow plows. I ran along these and jumped off them wildly, doing flips and rolls and generally just trying to smash myself up. I plowed headfirst into the snow for no particular reason.<br /><br />I was just moving. I wasn't necessarily playing a game with others. I was just running and jumping and falling and hitting whatever limb had the misfortune of being on the bottom when I made contact with the ground. To this day, I still don't know if a kid is too old to be doing this kind of thing in fourth grade. I don't really care I was. It was pure joy.<br /><br />One day that winter, I was in the boy's room with one other kid. I didn't know him, but my reputation must have preceded me, because he looked at me and said, "You're that kid who's always running around acting all nuts on the playground in the snow, right? Why do you do that?"<br /><br />"I'm training to be a stuntman when I grow up," I told him.<br /><br />"That's stupid," he said, drying his hands. "That's just a bunch of people risking their lives for entertainment." And with that, he stepped out of the bathroom and left me standing there to think about what he had just said.<br /><br />I never had any aspirations of being a stuntman. But when he asked me "Why?", I felt that I had to give him a reason. The actual answer to the question was _just because_. Because it was exhilarating. Because I was having fun. But I didn't think that answer would satisfy him. I sensed that would just confuse him or invite further ridicule, so I made something up.<br /><br />I remember remarkably little about my life in elementary school. And most of the details are fuzzy. But I do remember this happening pretty clearly. It was one of the first times I remember someone asking me to explain my actions, and I hid by concocting a fib based on some kind of rational pragmatism.<br /><br />The funny thing is that the fib didn't work. It backfired, because he criticized me anyway. And yet, I don't think this is the last time I did this in my life. In fact, I think I still do it. Almost every day. I explain myself to someone in terms I think that will satisfy them, even if they're not 100% true.<br /><br />These days, I try to do lots of things _just because_. I firmly believe that everyone should. Granted, activity does not equate to accomplishment...but some activities without an explicable "why" are good for the soul.
