The three sweetest letters you can tack on to the end of any email you send to a person: NRR. If you think they might not understand the acronym, then spell it out.<br /><br />I send several emails a day, and many of them don't require a response. I'd like to think that any person who has ever sent me an email has gotten a reply in a timely fashion. My goal is to answer all of them, when needed.<br /><br />But I send a lot of email inquiries that don't require a response. Sometimes a response would be nice, but I don't want to obligate the person to reply. It takes time, effort, and care in figuring out what to write to someone who has just written you.
