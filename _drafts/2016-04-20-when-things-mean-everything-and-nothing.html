In psychology, there is a concept known as "splitting". It's a tendency for a person to regard other people as either all good or all bad at any given time, depending on which vantage point is most beneficial for the person at that given time. In short, the person doesn't see others as people who sometimes do good and who also sometimes do bad; it's an either/or manner of thinking.<br /><br />I do this with the meaning of life. There are times when the life I'm leading seems positively bursting with purpose. Everything means something; you can find meaning in anything, and tie this meaning to some overall sequence of events that's playing out exactly as it should, even if it's impossible for me to understand how they all fit together. Naturally, it's very easy to feel extreme joy during these phases; there's nothing you can do that feels meaningless. You want for nothing; you are merely grateful.<br /><br />Other times, there doesn't seem to be any overarching purpose to anything. Everything means nothing; no purpose can be assigned, and nothing you do will have any overall impact on a long enough timeline. While you might think that these are times of intense sadness, for me, they actually aren't. When nothing means anything, you merely follow instinct and fall back on aesthetics. Look out the window, and you'll see a mourning dove perched on a tree branch that's swaying gently in the wind. The core truth that nothing <i>needs</i> to mean anything pervades your mind. It's only in these moments, when you've lost all sense of purpose, when you stop furiously trying to make <i>sense</i>&nbsp;of everything, that you can clearly perceive how beautiful all things, however simple, truly are.<br /><br />There is joy for me in each of these extremes. At each polar opposite, the feeling you have accumulates so much gravity that it collapses in on itself. The feeling disappears. Both total significance and utter insignificance give way to freedom.<br /><br />I run into difficulty in the large middle ground between both of these. It's here where some quantity of both purpose and purposelessness get tangled up in each other; this messy hybrid wreaks havoc on my psyche. The feeling of meaninglessness eats away at your motivation to do anything, while the feeling of a sense of purpose makes you afraid to do anything, lest you do the wrong thing and screw up what was meant to be.<br /><br /><br />
