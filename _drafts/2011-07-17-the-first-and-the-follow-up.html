I don't actually think that the first thing you do is all that difficult.<br /><br />The first book, the first movie, the first thing you ever do is not bogged down by anyone's expectations. <br /><br />Ivan Reitman could have just stopped after he did <em>Animal House</em>, or maybe after he got around to directing <em>Stripes</em>. Once you hit the nail on the head, you feel like the only thing you can possibly do is screw up.
