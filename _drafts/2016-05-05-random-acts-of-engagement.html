When I go out in public now, I try to engage people in conversation. I'll bounce a comment, question, or dumb joke off of them. I seek nothing but social connection, however brief it might be for us, but you can tell that they assume I have some ulterior motive. At some point in the interaction, they put their guard up and begin to distance themselves. Quite often, this happens as soon as I've opened my mouth.<br /><br />I understand this. Whenever I'm approached by a stranger, it's usually because that stranger wants something from me. They want to convert me to their religion. They want me to support a particular political cause. They're an "entrepreneur" that wants me to join whatever Ponzi scheme they're tangled up in.
