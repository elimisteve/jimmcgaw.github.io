Sitting here now in my early 30's, I'm completely relieved that my drinking days are behind me. Just the <i>thought</i>&nbsp;of drinking a beer is enough to make my thinking sluggish and my head heavy the following morning.<br /><br />Post-college, my approach to drinking has been cyclical; I've gone through several phases of casually imbibing and abstinence. The imbibing has typically gone along with what others around me are doing in various in social circles.<br /><br />I am vigilant about remaining not only introspective, but about re-evaluating how my habitual actions are affecting my life. Early on in my 20's, I started getting the sense that drinking socially, simply because it was the thing that all of my friends did, wasn't actually benefitting me in any way. The turning point was when the question changed from "Is there any good reason to stop drinking?" to "Is there any good reason to <i>continue</i>&nbsp;drinking?"<br /><br />As far as I know, I've never gotten self-righteous about this. Even if I suddenly decide to stop imbibing, I'll still associate with the same friends, some of whom will still be drinking. In my non-drinking phases, it wasn't as though there was a constant danger that threatened to push me back over the edge. I was actually quite centered; I didn't drink because it wasn't something I wanted, and it didn't really matter to me if I was surrounded by people who were drinking. The relationships were generally not founded upon the common ground of drinking.<br /><br />What shocked me was that this last point wasn't been true for everyone. The first time I ever decided to stop drinking, I was extremely surprised by some peoples' reactions. I remember one of my friends offering me a beer when I showed up at his house, and I politely declined. Oddly, he pressed me for a reason, so I came clean and told him I had given up drinking. He was visibly discomforted by this admission. In subtle ways, he verbally challenged me on my decision periodically for the rest of the evening, especially as other people arrived at his house to join him in drinking. It seemed very important to him that he convince me to reverse my decision, even though I didn't care one wit about the fact that he was&nbsp;drinking and never expressed anything to suggest that he should change <i>his</i>&nbsp;behavior.<br /><br />To most of my friends, it was a non-factor; little had changed about me in going from someone who drinks a few beers to a person who drinks zero beers. Many of my friends didn't even notice at first; it would dawn on them at some point, and they'd say, "Hey, I just realized you didn't have anything to drink the last few times we hung out. Did you give it up?" But there was certainly a subset of my friends who noticed immediately, and clearly, they did not like that I had given up drinking. A few of them found ways of distancing themselves from me.<br /><br />This isn't normal for most things. If I suddenly decide to change the programming language I'm working in, I've never encountered a fellow engineer who got uncomfortable because I was trying something new. Nobody's become agitated and stopped being friends with me because I stopped drinking coffee. (Also something I consume in cycles.) My life is rife with examples of me changing my behaviors and habits, just to see what happens, and alcohol seems to be the only one with the power to alter the texture of a friendship.<br /><br />So this is what I would suggest to anyone who drinks regularly during social occasions, as a social experiment: try <i>not</i>&nbsp;drinking for a while. Don't announce it as a grand change in your life; simply stop doing it. See who notices. Observe the reactions of those around you when you mention that you've given it up.
