        I found out this morning that Jack Kevorkian died last night, and I was more than little sad to hear the news. A small handful of my friends already know this, but when I was living in Royal Oak, MI, after college, Kevorkian moved into the apartment across the hall from me shortly after he got out of jail. He was my neighbor for about a year.<br /><br />I spoke with him a few times. In person, he was a genuinely nice guy; certainly not the incendiary pundit that he made himself out to be in the limelight. He shared with me his love of Einstein's philosophy, Bach, and of music in general. <br /><br />He also gave me a piece of advice that I've never forgotten. It's a prototypical maxim from an old man to a young one, but it stuck with me when he said it: "If there's anything you want to do in life, do it now, while you still have the time."<br /><br />Shortly after he moved in, I found out that he released a jazz album of his own composition shortly before he was incarcerated. I had to pay $30 on Amazon for a copy of the disc, but I found it as enjoyable as any jazz I've heard. Here's one of the tracks...somber, but soothing (and yes, that's him on the flute):<br /><br /><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-8ozvTgx--E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />We'll miss you Jack. Thanks for everything you did.

        Sometimes I'll ask someone a question that I think is interesting or insightful, and I get this reply.<br /><br />I met a UCSB graduate about my age, and I asked him, "How did you ever manage to concentrate, study hard, and graduate from a college with such a gorgeous campus right on the ocean?" <br /><br />I come from the Midwest, and the college I attended was landlocked and snowy most of the year, so this question seemed like I was stepping outside of my own skin and asking something from his point of view. He started with, "People ask that a lot..."<br /><br />And in my own mind, I make a mental note: if a particular type of person gets a question all the time, don't ask the next person you encounter matching those criteria that same question. Ask something else. <br /><br />I try to keep the conversation interesting, not dreadfully predictable.

        I read a Stanford study last year that said 75% of iPhone users sleep with their phones. Not just on the nightstand next to the bed, but actually <em>in the bed</em> with them. People said that using their iPhone was the last thing they did before they went to sleep and the first thing they did when they woke up in the morning.<br /><br />I thought this was surprising (I didn't own an iPhone back then), but it did give me a thought: why not make a stuffed animal that would act as a holder for the phone? For the last few months, I've been working on a side project to make it happen. Today, it launches on Kickstarter. I'd like to introduce you, dear reader, to Swoop the Owl:<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="410px" src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jimmcgaw/swoop-the-owl-mobile-plush-for-iphone-and-ipod-tou/widget/video.html" width="480px"></iframe><br /><br />We're interested in testing the marketability of the idea. For the last month or so, I've been running around town with the Swoop prototype in a pink shopping bag asking people to give me their opinion of him. (I imagine from their perspective, I must look quite silly.) So far, everyone loves the way he looks, and most people have said they'd certainly consider buying one. Teen and tween girls have been particularly enthusiastic about him.<br /><br />You can find him on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jimmcgaw/swoop-the-owl-mobile-plush-for-iphone-and-ipod-tou">Kickstarter.com here</a>. Any thoughts or feedback on the project are certainly welcome and appreciated here. And, if you know anyone who might be interested, please pass it along.<br /><br />(P.S. Tara helped me out a great deal with the project, even though the video barely gives her any credit. It's <em>our</em> idea, not mine. I consider her an equal partner in this, since I couldn't have done it without her.)

        The hardest part of starting up the first Starbucks wasn't in renting a location in Seattle. <br /><br />It wasn't buying some coffee machines and installing them in said location. <br /><br />It wasn't making sure the place was up to code so the health department would give them a pass. <br /><br />It wasn't making sure the design of the coffee in the bags was appealing enough so that people would buy them.<br /><br />It wasn't getting the money in line, making sure that there would be enough money to pay the bills in the first few months.<br /><br />That stuff all takes work, and none of it is easy. But the real difficulty behind starting the original Starbucks was in recognizing the potential of a new idea, and having the guts to test that new idea even in the distinct face of the possibility that it would fail.<br /><br />People who think all that other stuff is the hard part are the types of people who raced to follow in Starbucks' footsteps after they were successful. And this is the reason that they're forever doomed to operate in Starbucks' shadow.

      <h1><a href="/2011/05/30/our-groceries.html">Our Groceries</a></h1>

        I installed a simple app on my smartphone a few weeks ago, and one that has proven to be immensely helpful: it's called OurGroceries.<br /><br />And what does it do? It lets you manage shopping lists, which can be shared amongst multiple mobile devices. That means if I think of something I need to buy, I can just grab my phone, type it in, and whoever is doing the shopping this week will end up with it on their own phone as well. Simple, but I've been waiting quite a while for someone to build a workable version of this idea.<br /><br />The most obvious question: why on earth didn't Ralph's, Wal-Mart, Meijers, or any other grocery retailer make their own? I think there's an unmistakable opportunity here: if you were tracking not only what people bought, but also what they <em>intended</em> to buy, that seems like very valuable information.<br /><br />For example, if I put Charmin Ultra on my shopping list on June 1st, and on June 3rd, I end up purchasing Cottonelle, wouldn't that information be of pretty good use to the grocery store? Why did I change my purchase decision? Was it because the item was on sale? That would at least let the corporate HQ know which types of products, and which brands, for which I'm either price sensitive or insensitive.<br /><br />Those loyalty cards from grocery stores must be good for something, though I've yet to see what that is. None of the marketing offers I get seem to be targeted to me based on my past purchases.

      <div class="content">
        The job of a receptionist is never an easy one. At any given time, it seems like there's at least two things you need to be doing: both the work that no one else in the office wants to do, and handling the influx of people both by phone and coming in the door. Not only do they have to handle this, but they have to do it with a smile on their face.<br /><br />For this, you need two virtues: not only hard work, but patience as well. A very tall order.<br /><br />It always displeases me when I see a receptionist sitting there taking an earful from a customer. Meanwhile, the doctor, lawyer, or other professional is hiding in their office, avoiding the confrontation and letting the receptionist act as the gatekeeper for this discontent.<br /><br />I have a lot of delusions, and one of them is that maybe, one day, I'll be a VERY IMPORTANT GUY in charge of some VERY IMPORTANT THING, and I'll have an office, and so much work to do that I'll need a receptionist. When that happens, my goal is simple: have the receptionist do the work that is required of them.<br /><br /><em>But</em>, as soon as an irate customer shows up, I don't use the receptionist as a shield. That's precisely the point at which I would step in and act as the shield. If a customer has a problem with something I'm doing, and they need someone to listen to, then it's probably my fault, so it should be me.<br /><br />Or, if it isn't me, or if I'm really too busy to handle these kinds of things, then I'll make sure it's someone else. But not the receptionist; that shouldn't be part of their job.

        I like any idea, no matter how crazy, that seems to have an audience. If it speaks to a group of people, whether small or large, having an audience receptive to what you have to say is important if you're interested in having people listen.<br /><br />What I like even better, though, are ideas that have not only an audience, but an <em>anti-audience</em> as well. The pet rock certainly had its share of detractors after it came out. "You're paying for a rock in a box? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard."<br /><br />The value arises when members of the audience and the anti-audience find themselves in the same room as each other. This is the stuff that gets conversations started, when people start debating the merits of your idea. And debate is infinitely better than an idea that nobody is discussing.<br /><br />Flack is flack, period. You just have to be ready to take the bad with the good.

        Song lyrics to your favorite albums are an interesting mess right now.<br /><br />Digital music makes sense to me. But digital booklets accompanying digital music, much less so. I don't understand them. <br /><br />If I google the lyrics to any song, they come up right away, but more often than not, it's a site filled with ads and popups that is trying to sell me ringtones. Means to an end, but an unpleasant one.<br /><br />The liner notes to an LP or CD make sense because they're a physical good and bundling them adds to the experience of an album. They create a connection to the artist. But now, I have the music as MP3s, and if I want to feel connected to the artist, I look them up online.<br /><br />This still feels like an unsolved problem to me. If you're a musician releasing music online, I say that finding a great solution is an opportunity.

        Here's my own personal strategy when using social media: I represent myself.<br /><br />That's it. I'm dumb and probably come off as a goofball, but if you're friends with me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter, that's basically what you get: me.<br /><br />I've come across more than one company that asks its employees to use their own personal social media accounts to promote their product or service. I understand the thinking here...if there are large networks of people you can reach through your employees, why not tap into them?<br /><br />There are lots of reasons. I carefully guard my social networks. When I have anyone's attention, whether it's in person or online, I make a very concerted effort not to waste or abuse it. We're all short on time, so I try not to say too much. I'm not one of those people that posts 10 links in a row. Information glut isn't something I feel a need to contribute to.<br /><br />A company that asks me to tell my friends and family about their product or service has a problem, and it's not going to be solved by me telling my friends and family about them. When tapping employee's social networks becomes a core part of the marketing strategy, then it's definitely time to go back to the drawing board. <br /><br />Naturally, if an employee chooses to share something about you of their own volition, that's great. I'm not opposed to that. But if you have to ask them, then that's a desperate plea.<br /><br />I have a friend down in the LA area who opened his own custom body shop and graphics auto shop. He created a Facebook page and asked me to "Like" it. I think it's absolutely great that he started a business, and I'm rooting for him. Honestly, I am. I'd refer anyone I knew in Los Angeles to him if they asked me for a body shop recommendation. But most of the friends I have on Facebook are scattered throughout the country (not in LA), and to my knowledge, <em>none</em> of them are that enthusiastic about their cars. Me clicking "Like" on his page isn't going to have the desired effect. (Assuming, of course, that drumming up more business is his goal.)<br /><br />Marketing is about connecting with people who might be interested in what you're selling. Social media isn't always the answer for everyone.

        I was walking through an outdoor shopping mall earlier today when I was stopped by a guy with a rubber bracelet. "Are you interested?" he asked.<br /><br />I looked down at the item in his hand. "What is it?" I asked, since I was curious.<br /><br />Turns out, the answer to that question took about 5 minutes for him to get out, and it included a demonstration involving my participation in order for me to "get it".<br /><br />The product itself involved a good deal of pseudo-science ("Now with snake oil!"), and that's a problem in and of itself, but the bigger problem is that I didn't get it by looking at it. The learning curve for the product was a little bit too steep.<br /><br />For the sales pitch, I'd always favor the simplistic and jejune over the flashy and complicated.
