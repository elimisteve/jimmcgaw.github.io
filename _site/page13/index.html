                      I found out this morning that Jack Kevorkian died last night, and I was more than little sad to hear the news. A small handful of my friends already know this, but when I was living in Royal Oak, MI, after college, Kevorkian moved into the apartment across the hall from me shortly after he got out of jail. He was my neighbor for about a year.I spoke with him a few times. In person,...

                      Sometimes I'll ask someone a question that I think is interesting or insightful, and I get this reply.I met a UCSB graduate about my age, and I asked him, "How did you ever manage to concentrate, study hard, and graduate from a college with such a gorgeous campus right on the ocean?" I come from the Midwest, and the college I attended was landlocked and snowy most of the year, so this question seemed like...

                      I read a Stanford study last year that said 75% of iPhone users sleep with their phones. Not just on the nightstand next to the bed, but actually in the bed with them. People said that using their iPhone was the last thing they did before they went to sleep and the first thing they did when they woke up in the morning.I thought this was surprising (I didn't own an iPhone back then), but...

                      The hardest part of starting up the first Starbucks wasn't in renting a location in Seattle. It wasn't buying some coffee machines and installing them in said location. It wasn't making sure the place was up to code so the health department would give them a pass. It wasn't making sure the design of the coffee in the bags was appealing enough so that people would buy them.It wasn't getting the money in line, making...

                      I installed a simple app on my smartphone a few weeks ago, and one that has proven to be immensely helpful: it's called OurGroceries.And what does it do? It lets you manage shopping lists, which can be shared amongst multiple mobile devices. That means if I think of something I need to buy, I can just grab my phone, type it in, and whoever is doing the shopping this week will end up with it...

                      The job of a receptionist is never an easy one. At any given time, it seems like there's at least two things you need to be doing: both the work that no one else in the office wants to do, and handling the influx of people both by phone and coming in the door. Not only do they have to handle this, but they have to do it with a smile on their face.For this,...

                      I like any idea, no matter how crazy, that seems to have an audience. If it speaks to a group of people, whether small or large, having an audience receptive to what you have to say is important if you're interested in having people listen.What I like even better, though, are ideas that have not only an audience, but an anti-audience as well. The pet rock certainly had its share of detractors after it came...

                      Song lyrics to your favorite albums are an interesting mess right now.Digital music makes sense to me. But digital booklets accompanying digital music, much less so. I don't understand them. If I google the lyrics to any song, they come up right away, but more often than not, it's a site filled with ads and popups that is trying to sell me ringtones. Means to an end, but an unpleasant one.The liner notes to an...

                      Here's my own personal strategy when using social media: I represent myself.That's it. I'm dumb and probably come off as a goofball, but if you're friends with me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter, that's basically what you get: me.I've come across more than one company that asks its employees to use their own personal social media accounts to promote their product or service. I understand the thinking here...if there are large networks of...

                      I was walking through an outdoor shopping mall earlier today when I was stopped by a guy with a rubber bracelet. "Are you interested?" he asked.I looked down at the item in his hand. "What is it?" I asked, since I was curious.Turns out, the answer to that question took about 5 minutes for him to get out, and it included a demonstration involving my participation in order for me to "get it".The product itself...
