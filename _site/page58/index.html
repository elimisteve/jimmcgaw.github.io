        Here's the sign you always read in parking lots: "These spots are reserved for [business name] only. All others will be ticketed and towed."<br /><br />I don't think people even give these signs a second thought anymore. That's the standard, default wording you see on signs all over the place. If you've got a parking lot and want to tell people they shouldn't park in your spots to go into the business next door, this is the sign you'll probably be able to buy online pretty easily. You just put in the name of your company, place an order, and it's shipped to you.<br /><br />So why is something so callous and off-putting the default? "Don't park here or we'll tow your car"? How did we get to the point where we assume "asshole" is the only tone that people will motivate people or get their attention?<br /><br />There's an opportunity here: make a sign that's polite, asking them to not park there if they're not going to be offering your business their patronage.<br /><br />Better yet: make it a funny sign. How about "If you park here and you're not planning to shop at [business name], angry drunk leprechauns will kick the tires of your car when you leave."<br /><br />Better still: how about running a business that people love so much they're willing to park and walk a couple of extra blocks just to come shop at your store? That's much harder to do, but that's the kind of mentality and action that the market rewards.

        There's an old expression about how the squeaky wheel gets the grease. That is, the person who complains the loudest, or the most, gets the attention and catered to. It has a negative connotation, because generally the squeaky wheel is given the most attention even at the expense of serving the other, quieter wheels.<br /><br />If there's any lesson we learn repeatedly in grade school, it's not to squeak. Avoid making any squeaky sound at all costs. The grease is not something we want, but something we're afraid of: criticism. Stand out, get noticed, get ridiculed. That's the drill. So we shut up and squeak less.<br /><br />I think that as long as you're discerning about when you squeak, and what you squeak about, that it's not a bad thing. The expression and our negative perception of placating the squeaky wheel comes from squeakers that are voicing silly complaints or asking for more than they're due.<br /><br />As long as you're reasonable, we should probably aim to squeak more. The grease you get might not just be criticism, but the change you've been hoping for that helps you and lots of other people.

        "Kill your TV" is a slogan you see on bumper stickers and spray-painted on sidewalks. It's intended to influence people and get them to do something other than passively consume entertainment and mass media, blah blah. It's more than a little extreme, and it's off-putting. <br /><br />You don't have to kill your TV. I don't think you even have to get off the couch. Just put a project in front of you that you can work on while you watch TV. Turn your coffee table into a workstation. Put up an easel and see what you can paint while "American Idol" is on. Hammer out prose or poetry on your laptop. There's no reason you have to upend your whole lifestyle in order to start creating things.<br /><br />Self-expression is the new leisure.

        There's a small Greek hole-in-the-wall takeout place just off main street in Santa Barbara. It's not a very comfortable place. I'm six foot three, and I had to stretch to communicate with the purveyor over the very tall counter. How do shorter people do it?<br /><br />Right in plain sight when you walk in the door is a big sign reading "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone." What's the point of this sign? To remind your customers that they should behave? I understand that the place is just around the corner from a big stretch of bars, and it probably gets pretty rowdy in there on Friday and Saturday nights. <br /><br />But let's say for every three hundred people that enter the place to get food, one of them is going to be a rambunctious drunk and cause trouble. Is this sign going to have any effect in preventing them from being loud and obnoxious? And when they do act up, does the sign help in getting them to shut up? (Purveyor: "Hey, hey, hey!" [points to sign])<br /><br />Of course you have the right to refuse me service if I act out of line in your establishment. That's an implicit fact at just about every business open to the public. But posting a sign does little more than make the other 299 people who aren't misbehaving feel like children.

        I often hear someone talk about how they spent their lunch hour at work. "I went to get my tires rotated at this place a few miles away. I always go there because while they're doing it, I go hit golf balls at the driving range next door."<br /><br />That's a happy coincidence, isn't it? While you're waiting for some mechanics to rotate your tires, there's something nearby that you can kill time doing, something you enjoy, that doesn't involve sitting in some small room in uncomfortable chairs with crappy coffee.<br /><br />I hear stories like this all the time. My question: why are they always coincidences? Why is it an accident that these two things are juxtaposed, allowing for convenience, and making people want to talk about where they went to get their tires rotated?<br /><br />Want to find a good business idea? Find two of these coincidentals that people talk about and start a business that puts them together. <br /><br />Why not have an oil change place that has a waiting area with booths where you can practice driving golf balls against a screen? Put a pinball machine in the waiting area so people will have something to do other than just read magazines. You know where I want to get my tires rotated? The place that has the Go-Kart racetrack out back where I can spend my time racing in circles.<br /><br />That puts a spin on it for people with kids, doesn't it? Imagine on a Saturday:<br /><br />Daughter: "Dad, where are we going today?"<br />Dad: "We're going to go get the tires on Daddy's car rotated."<br />Daughter: "Yayyyy!"

        Take the following quote:<br /><br />"Everything that can be invented has been invented." -Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Patent Office, 1899.<br /><br />Now, if you Google the quote itself, you'll find that a lot of people are pointing out that it cannot be confirmed that Charles H. Duell, or anyone else at the U.S. Patent Office, ever said this. They mention that it's a cute quote when you consider the source, but the attribution is either mistaken or it's just made up.<br /><br />Does it really matter who said it, or, for that matter, if anyone ever said it in the first place? Who cares? The reason the quote continues to appear inside of most "How to Patent Your Inventions"-type books that are written is not because people expect it to have been verified but because it inspires. It reminds us of the timeless truth that most of us have a myopia about what we can dream up to solve our problems.<br /><br />If you really refuse to be inspired by the quote above because you can't confirm that it was ever uttered, here's a web page that lists several similar quotes from which you could draw inspiration.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/said/predictions.shtml">Things People Said - Bad Predictions</a><br /><br />Pick the one you like best and run with it.

        There's been a lot of talk lately about the Amazon Kindle and other digital readers arriving on the scene, mostly from publishers that are hoping that the digital options will just "go away" so they can stick to business as usual and making money from it.<br /><br />It's a complicated topic, but there's one issue that really makes me wonder if the major book publishers that are whining about digital books have their heads on straight. Traditionally, major book releases are staggered, with the hardcover edition coming out about a year before the trade paperback or mass market paperback. That makes sense; if you're patient enough to wait to read new books, you get to buy the paperback edition at a discount. (Or, put another way, if you're impatient, you get to pay a premium to read the hardcover edition early on. It just depends on how you frame it.)<br /><br />Now, with the digital format threatening to change the game, one consideration I've heard thrown around is releasing the hardcover, then releasing the paperback, and then, after a wait period, releasing the digital edition.<br /><br />Dumb idea. Let's say you look at publishing houses trying to break new authors: it depends on the publisher, but the general strategy is to find a bunch of authors, pay them as little as you can, push their books out there, and see which of them sell. It's like throwing noodles against the wall to see which one sticks.<br /><br />If you're a traditional book publisher, still printing up books the way Gutenberg intended well over <em>500</em> years ago, then testing new authors is a very, very expensive process that requires a significant investment. Digital copies can be produced and distributed for <em>almost nothing</em>. The hardest part is getting talented writers to write them.<br /><br />Given digital books, you can test as many new books and authors as you want, with a very small initial investment. The ones that sell well you can print up in hardcover and paperback form, and distribute them to bookstores. It probably depends on the book, but if people really liked what they read on their Kindle, many of them will buy the physical book when it comes out.<br /><br />Seems to me the digital copies should come out first, not last.<br /><br />Of course, they've been pissing and moaning about Amazon wanting to sell digital books at a price point of $9.99. The publishing industry claims that they can't make money on digital books if they're sold for that cheap per copy. <br /><br />First of all, I don't believe that for a <em>second</em>. The production costs are still there, but the cost of raw materials, distribution, and carrying cost falls to almost nothing. The overhead is reduced so drastically that going from $27.99 to $9.99 is not, I don't think, taking a loss on each copy. Sure, I might believe that they can't make <em>as much</em> money as they did with hard copies (maybe), but they can't be losing money.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, I'm not sure we (as readers and writers) should really be too worried about what happens to the publishing industry. They want us to believe that if they all went out of business tomorrow that writers would stop writing, that the ideas would dry up, books would disappear and the world would turn into a <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>-style nightmare, and we'd all have only ourselves to blame because we all started buying digital books.<br /><br />There are self-publishing sites out there for authors to get their books printed and sold that are making money, and in those cases, the authors get to keep most of it. Sounds to me like maybe the business model that traditional publishers are using might not be working so well if they can't seem to make money. In a world that's becoming increasingly full of digital goods, does it make sense to keep running a company that loses money on digital books?<br /><br />Some very smart authors are even giving away their books on the Kindle, for free, hopeful that they'll turn people into fans who will later purchase books from them. Which brings to me to my final couple of points: one, there are a lot of smart authors out there who understand how to build an audience.<br /><br />Two, the value in books is not in the paper on which they're printed, it's what's written inside of them. Scarcity creates value, and in a world where books are only available as physical things and not just anyone can start printing up lots of copies of books without a lot of money up front, it's very lucrative to be a book publisher. But now, anyone can share their writing on a blog, for free. There are too many other mediums available to writers to get people to read their work, that being able to print up books isn't necessarily scarce enough to get people to pay for them.<br /><br />To clarify, I don't think that digital books will ever replace physical copies of books. But the existing book publishers that learn how to leverage the existence of digital books, instead of complaining about how they're ruining the industry, are the ones who are still going to be around in 10 or 20 years.

        I went to a show about a year ago at which David Fincher was presented with a "Modern Master" award for the films he's directed. There was a two-hour interview with him on stage, and he talked about the movies he had directed. Interspersed throughout the interview were little clips from his films that were shown on a big screen.<br /><br />After watching a clip from <em>Se7en</em>, the interviewer asked Fincher how it felt to watch his work on the old screen. He visibly grimaced and said, "It's a little like looking at old photos of yourself from middle school. They just embarrass you."<br /><br />Whatever you're working on today, it almost inevitable that it will end up embarrassing you years from now when you look back on it. I say, whatever you're doing, whatever kind of art you're creating, go into it with the expectation that you'll embarrass yourself. Accept it right from the start. Embrace it. Don't let it stop you.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I'd take it a step further: don't just plan to embarrass yourself; <em>promise</em> yourself that you will. This commits you to doing two things:<br /><br />1. Finishing what you're working on, even though it might not be perfect.<br /><br />2. When you're done with the current project, you'll do other projects after that.<br /><br />Whatever the medium, finishing today's project enables to start other projects tomorrow. And being able to look back later and see something in your old work that is embarrassing is just a paper trail. It's evidence that you've gotten better as an artist, or writer, or filmmaker.<br /><br />If you're not embarrassed by past work, you're not getting better.

        On Facebook, you can "Become a Fan" of most cities in the country. My favorite variation on this is when the name takes the form of "You know you're from [city name] when..." and the info on the page itself is a list of little in-jokes that only people who live or had lived in the city might get.<br /><br />Usually we just browse the ones for cities where we've lived, because we want to get the jokes. But why not use this to research cities that you're planning to visit? It won't make you as aware as a local might be, but it might make you curious about a few things that you wouldn't have otherwise known about, and it'll help you asked more informed questions once you get into town. If you're about to move to a new city, I'd say it makes even more sense.<br /><br />There's one for the city where I live, which is Santa Barbara. There is a page for them, and here is one of my favorites from that page:<br /><br />"...John Cleese has almost run you over at least once."<br /><br />Apparently he lives in town, and I guess he's not a very good driver when it comes to dealing with pedestrians. (or so I would presume) It's part of the reason I'll often cross the street at traffic lights against a red. You never know who might hit you with their car around here.

        Several months ago, a new neighbor moved into the empty unit in our apartment building two doors down from us. He was quirky, and a little more friendly at first than most people I've lived in the same apartment building with. He told me he was was a former UC Berkley football player, which didn't come as a huge surprise due to this foreboding build. But, my first impression of him was that he was a little naive, and not much else.<br /><br />About a week later, he said something that struck me as very odd. "I need your opinion about something," he told me. "The people on television have been stealing my thoughts and twisting them around and saying them back to me. I don't know what to do about it." With raised eyebrows, I told him I didn't really have any good advice for him.<br /><br />Later, the yelling started. Late at night, we heard him outside on our shared balcony, yelling obscenities into the night when no one else was around. He rambled a lot of nonsense, shouting angry strings of words that often went into racist and homophobic territory. This happened several different nights. The police showed up more than once.<br /><br />A frequent visitor to his apartment, who turned out to be an old high school friend of his, once came over to talk to me, apologizing on his behalf. "You realize that he's a paranoid schizophrenic, right?" I told him that, yes, we had managed to figure that out from his behavior. His friend told me he had medication he was supposed to take, but he didn't like to take it because it was heavy stuff, and made him lazy and tired.<br /><br />He moved out a few months later, after several of our other neighbors complained. Fortunately, he had his family to fall back on, so my guess is he's back with his parents. After the fact, I do feel sincerely sorry for people in his predicament. They see and hear things that aren't there. When I was younger, I often wondered if homeless people talk to themselves just because they're lonely, but it turns out, they're not. They're responding to an internal stimuli, which is a psychotic state.<br /><br />On the long list of things we shouldn't take for granted, we can add the ability to perceive the world around us the way it really is.
