        Here's the one-line summary of the directive in today's post: <em>acquire a useless skill</em>.<br /><br />Daymond John, the founder of the FUBU clothing line, was able to successfully launch his own line of clothes (and become a millionaire) because he knew how to sew.<br /><br />I'm willing to put good money on the fact that while he was growing up, there was very little reason for him to learn to sew. It was just something his mother taught him how to do. He learned it, even though there was likely no good reason for him to learn how to do it at the time. As a matter of fact, for most males growing up in this country, there are lots of decidedly "good" reasons <em>not</em> to learn to sew. (To avoid being made fun of, etc.)<br /><br />And yet, he did it anyway, and it worked out very well for him. Lesson learned: the skills you have in your arsenal matter a great deal, and to any budding entrepreneur, <em>no skill is 100% useless</em>. It's applicability might be not be immediately apparent to you, but the further away any skill's domain lies from your own, the closer you should look at it.

        In the early nineteenth century, a British inventor by the name of Charles Babbage designed a massive fifteen-ton device which he called a Difference Engine. Comprised of 25,000 mechanical parts, it was designed to solve calculus equations.<br /><br />He didn't end up finishing it, but what Babbage envisioned was basically a very large version of the modern computer. And he did it almost a century before computers started being produced. I think this is crazy: in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, he tried to build a computer, in much the same way that you might have gone about constructing a steam engine, by assembling a lot of large mechanical parts. <br /><br />He didn't succeed not because he had a bad idea, but because the world wasn't quite ready for it. He aimed to jump too far ahead of the rest of the world, and the limits weren't with what he was able to conceive of, but what the technology in the world at the time would permit him to do. If he had been around 50 years later, he might have been able to make a dent. (Makes you wonder what some people are creating today that are good ideas, but we're not ready for them.)<br /><br />One friend told me yesterday about a tablet touch-screen device that Apple created back in the early 1990s. It completely flopped in the marketplace, probably because people were still getting acquainted with personal computers and the Internet. <br /><br />For many years, people were slow to adopt the use of MP3 players. Digital music made a ton of sense, but there just wasn't a singular compelling reason to get rid of your Discman until Apple succeeded in marketing the iPod. This made people comfortable with the notion of carrying around a squarish device containing digital music, which likely made the world more ready to accept the iPhone when it emerged years later. And the iPad likely owes much of its success to the presence of the iPhone.<br /><br />It's a common myth that innovation happens in leaps and bounds, in large wild steps that nobody sees coming until they actually happen. There are probably exceptions, but most innovations aren't a giant leap from the present. They happen because they've built slowly, bit by bit, on the things that came before.

        It's interesting to talk to people about what non-profits or causes they support, and the reasons why. Some people feel that efforts should be directed at reducing human suffering, by combating hunger or poverty. Others believe that we should combat human suffering by finding cures for diseases, or supplying people with the means to prevent disease. (Think mosquito nets.) And many others feel that the environment should come first, because that affects everyone on the planet...it won't do any good to feed hungry people if global warming is going to fry us all, so to speak.<br /><br />The kinds of things people choose to support is telling about their priorities. We all know that we live in a world where aid to the needy is scarce. You only have so many dollars to give in a year. If you give a dollar to support clean water initiatives in the third world, that's one less dollar that can go to cancer research. We weigh the trade-offs, and make our decision based on what we think is most important.<br /><br />The reasons vary, and they're usually based on personal experience. Regardless of the reasons, there's an awful lot of generosity in this world, especially amongst people who aren't even wealthy.

        I was working in the office late one night a couple of weeks ago when I got the urge to watch a scene from one of my favorite movies. Since I didn't have the DVD handy, I found the entire movie was posted in 10-minute segments on YouTube. <br /><br />And so I watched the whole thing on there. It wasn't the most convenient thing in the world, to be clicking a new video every ten minutes, but I found that it was interesting to read the comments for each section of the video. While I was watching something I had seen dozens of times before, I was reading what other people were saying about particular scenes.<br /><br />This experience isn't really available anywhere that I know of. I got lucky, in that someone happened to have pirated the entirety of the movie I wanted to watch and stuck it online. And on YouTube, a lot of the comments were posts by anonymous trolls (a redundant phrase) who were just trying to start arguments about unrelated matters.<br /><br />But this doesn't exist on Netflix. There are reviews, but not inline comments from other people like me that are available to me as I'm watching the movie. For those who remember the show "Pop-up Video" on VH1, being able to see little comments while I'm watching the movie sounds like it might be an interesting experience. (As long as it's an option I can turn on and off.)<br /><br />This isn't like watching a DVD at home. It's not really like anything I can think of, but I think it would be a good social experience for even the casual moviegoer.<br /><br />Another idea: let people choose their favorite scenes from the movies they like and share them with others. Other people can "up vote" these selections, much like on social bookmarking sites like reddit.com or digg.com. The items with the most recent votes are displayed in an ever-shifting "Top 20" list that everyone can click to watch the chosen scenes.<br /><br />Maybe video is still relatively young on the Internet. I'll bet we see these things crop up somewhere in the next five years.

        This is the platitude that's best known for breaking up bar fights.<br /><br />The other day I was walking down the street and witnessed a car approach an intersection to turn right a little too hastily. In the process, they nearly hit a pedestrian crossing the street. Fortunately, they managed to stop in time without anyone getting hurt.<br /><br />Five years ago, I think this would have made me angry. It's a situation that I wasn't involved with, nothing bad happened (although it could have). And even if something bad had happened, my getting angry wouldn't have helped the situation any. If I chose to intervene, it likely wouldn't affect the driver's future behavior and it certainly wouldn't get the paramedics on their way to help.<br /><br />This time, I didn't get angry. Not worth it.<br /><br />This phrase is a question that should become a personal mantra: "Is it worth it?" We should get comfortable asking it, and asking it often, before we do anything.<br /><br />You've only got so many hours in the day and so many days in each week. How many do you want to spend watching television? I don't mean to pick on television, but: after how many hours does television stop being "worth it"? <br /><br />What is your time worth to you?

        One of the best books I've ever read: Dale Carnegie's <em>How To Win Friends and Influence People</em>.<br /><br />To anyone reading this, the reputation of the book is surely preceding my mention of it here. So I'll keep this very, very simple: <em><strong>required reading in all public schools in the country</strong></em>.<br /><br />I read lots of books in English classes as a young whippersnapper, and not a single one of them make a dent in my thickish skull half as much as this one did. To this day what I read in it still drives what I do from day to day. I can't say that much for F. Scott Fitzgerald. (Sorry, Scottie.)<br /><br />I read it when I was 20. This was lucky. I was young enough that the words in the book were assimilated into my everyday mode of thinking. But younger still would have been better. I say make all 9th graders, all freshman in high school, read it. The whole thing. You have to demonstrate that you read it and <em>learned</em> from it, either through a test, an essay, a series of Twitter posts, or maybe having to go down the the bus stations and convinced five complete strangers to purchase something from you. You don't get to go on to 10th grade until you've done it, <em>no exceptions</em>.<br /><br />If you're a little bit older and you've never read it, you're behind. Go find a copy and read it, not once, but once every six months until it starts to stick.<br /><br />There is an entire education in this book, and it's one that a lot of people I meet have never learned...even if they happened to have read the book.<br /><br />A popular criticism of the book, in so many words: "It teaches you to be a phony." To these piping Holden Caulfields, I say, the solution to this problem is simple: after you read the book, don't go out into the world and be a phony.<br /><br />You'll waste a lot of effort and get frustrated quickly if you spend your time smashing your head against human nature (or rather, the nature of people). Much better to learn to accommodate its idiosyncrasies. Dale will happily tell you how.

        My girlfriend and I share a Netflix account. By mail, this probably happens a great deal: a couple or a household of people share one account, all getting movies sent to them.<br /><br />Netflix held a contest that awarded $1 million to any person or team that could improve the quality of their recommendation algorithm by 10%. That is, given any particular individual's viewing history and the viewing history of every other person as inputs, can you tailor the recommendations to this particular individual in way that increases their delight?<br /><br />There are some "simple" ways of doing this. Take, for example, the <a href="http://mines.humanoriented.com/classes/2010/fall/csci568/portfolio_exports/sphilip/pear.html">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a> (nerd alert!), which plots data on an Cartesian graph and gets the distance between the preferences of two users. Compare every user in the system to every other one and you can match the closer viewers together.<br /><br />The biggest problem lies in the second input: everyone else's viewing history. Because, for a family of four sharing a Netflix queue, the viewing history isn't a single point on the chart, but the murky haze between several scattered ones. I'm no math guru, but this is bound to screw up the margin of error when making comparisons between families, couples, and individuals.<br /><br />Someone won this contest. And my guess is that the winning algorithm took this into account in some fashion. Maybe it made guesses about how many individuals were using the account based on how scattered the viewing history was for each account.<br /><br />But about a year ago, we hooked up Netflix to our Wii and started watching a lot of stuff on Instant Play. The Netflix delivery has become digital. More importantly, the Instant Queue that my girlfriend and I share has become cluttered with each other's items. Let's ignore for the moment that the Queue itself quickly grows very large. I get recommendations for the television show "Table for 12" and she has to see the recommendations that result from my watching "South Park".<br /><br />Even between the two of us, the recommendations we're getting are cross-contaminated. And I guarantee that even though the demographics between the audience for "Table for 12" and "South Park" barely overlap that it's affecting the recommendations for all of the people who watch either show.<br /><br />Simple fix: take a cue from the Wii console itself, in which each user can create a "Mii" (this of it as a cheesy avatar) that looks just like a cartoon version of themselves. <br /><br />Netflix could do this. When you first start up the app, you can go to your own personal Instant Queue to watch stuff and to get recommendations. You can put your name in, and there's an omnipresent "switch users" option at the bottom right of the screen. If I log in and it's under "Tara", could just switch to "Jim" and be taken right to my own personal Instant Queue.<br /><br />I haven't done any exhaustive research on this, so it's pretty likely someone at Netflix has thought of this, and they're probably building it. This small addition wouldn't involve any scary mathematics. If not, I'm willing to bet that this simple addition to their app would probably boost the quality of their ratings by <em>at least</em> 10%. Wouldn't it?<br /><br />If nothing else, it would make their engineers' job easier, as well as make the experience of using their service better for me. I think it's a win-win.

        People don't set out to do things that are hard.<br /><br />Usually they don't. It's not normal behavior. People do things that are easy, and if they set out to do something difficult, they take it in small, manageable chunks, in an effort to make it easier.<br /><br />This is why I have trouble when people come to me with great ideas. The better the idea, the harder it's apt to be. I tend to err on the side of telling people to "go for it" even if it seems that they have a massive struggle ahead of them. Sometimes I feel as though my encouragement is "puffing", or at best it's a lie of omission, but we only start things when we've tricked our brains into thinking that it will be an easy task.<br /><br />I really think that good ideas need encouragement, and not a reality check. Let reality check itself.

        Late at night, a police officer pulls over a car for going a little bit too fast. It's a regular traffic stop, and the officer doesn't work in particularly dangerous neighborhood. So, as far as the officer on duty is concerned, it's a pretty routine thing that he's been doing for well over ten years.<br /><br />And yet, he approaches the car with caution. As the driver rolls down his window, the officer is using all of his senses to look for suspicious signs of a threat. He looks for weapons. He watches every move the driver makes as they reach for the glove box for their registration. They're prepared, at the drop of hat, to pull their holstered weapon in self-defense.<br /><br />The problem with being a police officer, and with several other professions, is that you have to assume the worst of people. 99% of the time (hopefully), you don't get it, but you have to go into every situation with your guard up and the assumption that something bad might happen.<br /><br />This isn't a bad thing in and of itself, because it makes a great defense mechanism. But assumptions drive expectations, and when you learn to expect something, you start to see it everywhere, regardless of whether or not it's actually there. The people around you, your friends and family, don't get any worse, but you start to see the worst parts of them amplified, at least in your own mind.<br /><br />Expectations are immensely powerful because they influence perception, which is (our) reality. But if you, like me, have a job that allows (or even requires) you to expect the best of people, you can add that to your list of things to be grateful for, because great expectations are a powerful force for making the world seem better.

        There's one aspect of the art community that's sorely lacking from other industries, and it's the reputation of the master.<br /><br />Was walking down the street with a friend of mine the other day, and he said, "Over here, behind this building, there's a painting on the wall. I'm pretty sure it's a Banksy."<br /><br />You hear this in art museums all the time. People refer to the work of an artist as a singular piece of them. ("A Picasso." "A Rembrandt.") It's the mark of an accomplished artist with a distinctive style that's instantly recognizable. <br /><br />You don't hear people say that sort of thing about video games. Or craft jewelry being sold on Etsy. Or children's toys. Consumer goods are typically branded by a company name instead of the name of the individual.<br /><br />Since we live in an era when anyone can own the means of production (all you need is a laptop), it makes a lot of sense to strive to make your own work referred to as "a [your name]".
