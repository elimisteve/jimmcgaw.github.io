                      In the early nineteenth century, a British inventor by the name of Charles Babbage designed a massive fifteen-ton device which he called a Difference Engine. Comprised of 25,000 mechanical parts, it was designed to solve calculus equations.He didn't end up finishing it, but what Babbage envisioned was basically a very large version of the modern computer. And he did it almost a century before computers started being produced. I think this is crazy: in the...

                      It's interesting to talk to people about what non-profits or causes they support, and the reasons why. Some people feel that efforts should be directed at reducing human suffering, by combating hunger or poverty. Others believe that we should combat human suffering by finding cures for diseases, or supplying people with the means to prevent disease. (Think mosquito nets.) And many others feel that the environment should come first, because that affects everyone on the...

                      I was working in the office late one night a couple of weeks ago when I got the urge to watch a scene from one of my favorite movies. Since I didn't have the DVD handy, I found the entire movie was posted in 10-minute segments on YouTube. And so I watched the whole thing on there. It wasn't the most convenient thing in the world, to be clicking a new video every ten minutes,...

                      This is the platitude that's best known for breaking up bar fights.The other day I was walking down the street and witnessed a car approach an intersection to turn right a little too hastily. In the process, they nearly hit a pedestrian crossing the street. Fortunately, they managed to stop in time without anyone getting hurt.Five years ago, I think this would have made me angry. It's a situation that I wasn't involved with, nothing...

                      One of the best books I've ever read: Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends and Influence People.To anyone reading this, the reputation of the book is surely preceding my mention of it here. So I'll keep this very, very simple: required reading in all public schools in the country.I read lots of books in English classes as a young whippersnapper, and not a single one of them make a dent in my thickish skull half...

                      My girlfriend and I share a Netflix account. By mail, this probably happens a great deal: a couple or a household of people share one account, all getting movies sent to them.Netflix held a contest that awarded $1 million to any person or team that could improve the quality of their recommendation algorithm by 10%. That is, given any particular individual's viewing history and the viewing history of every other person as inputs, can you...

                      People don't set out to do things that are hard.Usually they don't. It's not normal behavior. People do things that are easy, and if they set out to do something difficult, they take it in small, manageable chunks, in an effort to make it easier.This is why I have trouble when people come to me with great ideas. The better the idea, the harder it's apt to be. I tend to err on the side...

                      Late at night, a police officer pulls over a car for going a little bit too fast. It's a regular traffic stop, and the officer doesn't work in particularly dangerous neighborhood. So, as far as the officer on duty is concerned, it's a pretty routine thing that he's been doing for well over ten years.And yet, he approaches the car with caution. As the driver rolls down his window, the officer is using all of...

                      There's one aspect of the art community that's sorely lacking from other industries, and it's the reputation of the master.Was walking down the street with a friend of mine the other day, and he said, "Over here, behind this building, there's a painting on the wall. I'm pretty sure it's a Banksy."You hear this in art museums all the time. People refer to the work of an artist as a singular piece of them. ("A...
