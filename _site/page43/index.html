        One of my favorite quotes comes from Galileo, who once said, "You cannot teach a man anything...you can only help him find it within himself." For instructional teaching, this maxim probably doesn't apply. I don't imagine any of us are born with the knowledge of how a car works...hence, the manual in driver's ed. Where it <em>does</em> hold true is for inspirational teaching, or the teaching of general truths about the world.<br /><br />I actually don't think that the quote itself is directed at teachers. Sure, it's good advice for a teacher who is looking to reach an audience of adults; you generally cannot just jam knowledge into peoples' heads and have them accept it. And you can't inspire by fiat. What you have to do is more subtle. You have to, as Galileo suggests, help a man reach the conclusion for himself.<br /><br />I think the advice is better for students to heed. When we sit down to learn, it would make it a whole lot easier if we opened ourselves up and accept things that don't necessarily come from within, but from without as well. It's a good limitation of the human mind to be well aware of.<br /><br />At one end of the spectrum, teachers are pushers. They make an effort to push knowledge onto their students. Galileo suggests that it's much more effective (and I agree) to try and pull such life lessons out of students, and let them discover them for themselves.<br /><br />I try to remain at the other end of the spectrum, where I (as a student) attempt to pull lessons from the outside world, without them having to be pushed upon me. It amounts to little more than curiosity, but it helps me keep myself in check.

        ...is because they're the two functions in any organization that contribute to revenue. Everything else contributes to cost.<br /><br />Sure, I hate the high-pressure used-car salesman who's doing everything in his power to extort money out of you for a lemon. And I hate the retail sales person who, like an incessant gnat at a picnic, buzzes around you trying to sell you something you don't need. But these vexations are extremes and, like most extremes, are in the minority.<br /><br />If you go into a store and clerk actually makes you happy to buy something you didn't go into the store to buy, we don't think of them as a salesperson. Like most things, when it's done correctly, we don't notice it's being done at all.<br /><br />Every organization is driven by everyone, in all departments, each doing their part to add value to the end product or service that people are buying. But everything, no matter what it is, needs to be sold. Samuel Morse had to run around furiously trying to get someone to realize the potential of his code...it didn't just sell itself.<br /><br />When you cash your paycheck at the end of the month, you can probably thank a salesperson, somewhere down the line, for helping you earn it, too.

        When you're watching television and you see a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV1LWhNpTJU">man getting hit in the groin</a>, you feel their pain. As the observer, your gut clenches up and you bend over, almost as if you yourself had been hit. On a logical level, you know you're not in any danger, but your brain still reacts as though what you're witnessing is actually happening to you.<br /><br />Scientists call the cells in our brain responsible for driving these kinds of reactions "mirror neurons". Of course they work when we see another person in peril or injured...I suspect that they're the foundation for the emotion we call empathy.<br /><br />I also suspect that they don't just work for pain, but pleasure as well. One of my favorite things to do is sit outside and look at the mountains. I'll conjure up the images of John Locke, a character from the TV show "Lost", sitting placidly on the beach and staring out at the water, and it tranquilizes me.<br /><br />To attain contentment, visualize a contented person.

        If you're selling toilet paper to everyone in the world, you probably need to be pretty politically correct. When a Charmin ultra commercial comes on, you're doomed, because the message is going to be watered down, uninteresting, and crafted to speak to the widest possible audience. They want <em>everyone</em> to buy their toilet paper.<br /><br />I'm not convinced this is the correct approach. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9oG49INm4">video created by Lane Bryant</a> that's making fun of Victoria's Secret commercials, and the way a woman is expected to look in general. I think it's a little silly, but it definitely wouldn't be well-received by a mass audience.<br /><br />But there is an audience. Someone is listening and spreading this message, and no wonder...people generally don't clump around what <em>is</em>, but instead around the edges. That's where the interesting people are, and people who are doing interesting work.<br /><br />(Thanks to <a href="http://blog.kiwicreative.net/2010/05/26/victorias-secret-ad-spoof/">Jen</a> for sharing.)

        In cinema-speak, a logline is basically an elevator pitch. It's a one-sentence summary of plot of the movie you want to write. If you're a screenwriter running around desperately trying to get someone in Hollywood to listen to your story idea, you'd better have a worthwhile (and short) logline that embodies the essence of the story you want to tell.<br /><br />Here's the one for <em>Die Hard</em>: "A New York cop visits his estranged wife in LA at Christmas time and her office building is taken hostage by terrorists."<br /><br />Once you've got a logline, should you tell it to anyone? Some people are afraid of sharing their idea, and I'm guessing it's due to the fear that someone might steal it. I think this fear is baseless, since the value behind any idea lies in the details, and the details come only after the execution. I'm pretty sure Hollywood has been stealing loglines from itself for years, with results that end up quite different from one another. Think <em>Freaky Friday</em> and <em>Vice Versa</em>, or <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Deep Impact</em>.<br /><br />As far as sharing ideas goes, there's also the fear of rejection. Personally, I like to share things as quickly as possible, to get the rejections out of others quickly, before I sit on an idea for too long and become endowed with a deluded sense of its "greatness".<br /><br />(P.S. Here's a logline I came up with last month, for a screenplay I might write as soon as I figure out who the characters are: "A millionaire accidentally kills a homeless man with his car, and as the funeral is planned, he's surprised to learn how much he has in common with the deceased.")

        In the movie <em>Amadeus</em>, Antonio Salieri recounts his life in his old age, his love of music, and his hatred of a composer named Mozart. Mozart, he claimed, was always able to create better music than he, and it drove Salieri crazy because he so desperately wanted to create great music. Yet, he lived in the shadow of this young musical prodigy, who was so much more adept at composing and for whom it seemed to be effortless.<br /><br />And so, Salieri stewed. He questioned his faith and railed against the heavens for instilling in him the drive to create music without giving him the ability. And in the end of the movie, Salieri poisons Mozart in a jealous rage. (Critics question the historical accuracy of the latter part of the film.)<br /><br />Salieri could have continued to focus on his music. He could have committed to writing a new musical piece each and every day, no matter how lousy it might have been. And instead, he focused his efforts on sabotaging Mozart.<br /><br />Most of us aren't Mozarts, endowed with natural ability and talent that flows out of us without a struggle. That means we have the same choice. And as it turns out, being imperfect is a pretty common excuse for not trying, because in almost every walk of life, someone is busy out-doing and out-performing us in the same area. Cynicism is a lousy defense.<br /><br />Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly, until you can do it better. Salieri chose wrong.

        I play Texas Hold 'em in a casino for the first time in a very long time. It was very surreal being surrounded by a bunch of strangers, who are all being very polite to one another but battling for chips, and all the while I'm trying to use everything that I had read in poker books in the heat of the moment. I can see why people develop a habit of playing poker.<br /><br />There's a reason that I don't much like the game of poker, and that's because it is, in reality, a zero-sum game. That is, in order for me to win, you (or someone else) has to lose. It's not possible for everyone to emerge on top, and so it's the kind of game where people are in constant conflict with one another. These are common, and I like these kinds of game infinitely better than those based purely on chance. (See also: Chutes and Ladders, or speculation in the stock market)<br /><br />One way to determine the type of person you are is to reflect on the extent to which you see the world as a zero-sum game. How about your profession? If you're in retail sales in a department store, it's easy to see the other sales associates on your floor as being in direct competition with you. There are a limited number of customers that walk in and buy something every day, and the more of those sales you get, the better off you are when compared to your colleagues. So it becomes a competition.<br /><br />Or: could you look at the sales process as building brand? Sure, you don't <em>give</em> sales to your co-workers to even things out just because you're a nice person. But if you stop worrying about how much better your co-workers are doing than you and instead focus on serving the customer to the best of your ability, then the customer is more likely to be happy and come back. And they're more likely to recommend the store to their friends. And in the end, wouldn't that lead to more sales for your entire department as a whole? With a larger pie, doesn't that mean everyone gets a bigger slice, and that there are more slices for the taking?<br /><br />I'm not saying that's the way things <em>are</em>. I'm merely asking you to ask yourself what <em>you</em> think. How do you see the world?<br /><br />In the end, though, you could argue that people who are losing at poker aren't really losing. I went into the game I mentioned earlier with $100 in chips, and three hours later, after lots of ups and downs, I walked away with $96. A nominal loss, but I was willing to have lost a little more, and it was money I invested in spending an afternoon. It ended up being cheaper than a movie and more engaging. <br /><br />I guess even when we're at each other's throats, we're learning. And any game of skill beats a game of pure chance.

        When asked about how he built his steel empire and managed to turn over three dozen people he had hired to work for him into millionaires (quite an accomplishment for the 1930's), Andrew Carnegie replied:<br /><br />"Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. <em>But you don't go into the mine looking for the dirt</em>."<br /><br />Wise words coming from one of the most successful businessmen of the 20th century; real leaders help those under them find the brilliance within themselves, rather than trying to instill it by fiat. <br /><br />But I would go one step further and ask: why kind of gold are you looking for? We tend to go digging for a particular type of mineral depending on the person we're dealing with. We don't usually ask the receptionist her opinion about the marketing strategy. Programmers don't ask the sales people their opinion about a problem they're having, or vice versa. <br /><br />Part of this is out of consideration for the other person...when dealing with problems in different domains, you don't want to burden someone with reviewing your work. But assuming the other person is able and willing to quickly offer their opinion, we don't always ask for it, simply because a critique of our work is an uncomfortable thing to face...especially if that person isn't in our department or if we don't think they're as skilled as we are.<br /><br />We have goggles we use when panning for gold; I'm not convinced we always know it when we see it.

I found this lock sitting right by the typical three-number combination lock.<br /><br />Here's how it works: you put your thumb on the round lump in the center, and you can slide it one of four directions: up, down, left, and right. (Easy.) In order to open it, you slide it in four directions and then pull. If you get the right combination of directions, it opens.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest soft innovations I've seen in a long time. It's a new solution for old technology. And it's great for three reasons:<br /><br />1. <em>You don't have to remember a bunch of numbers.</em> I don't know about you, but I've got enough numbers I have to juggle in my brain. I don't need any more for anything as insignificant as some combination lock.<br /><br />2. <em>You can be imprecise.</em> Typical number-wheel combination locks are very unforgiving. If you go past the third number as you're spinning the wheel, you have to start all over again. <br /><br />3. <em>You can do it with one hand.</em> As far as accessibility goes, I haven't tested it with a group of people with arthritis, but my guess is that this lock, with it's huge button on the front, is easier on the hand than having to grab that little wheel and spin it.<br /><br />It cost about twice as much as a regular combination lock, but I think ease of use is well worth it. If you need a lock, buy this one...we need to incentivize companies to engineer things that are usable by non-engineers.

        Fame occurs when a person has more inbound attention then they are able to respond to. It's when a person can no longer answer every single email they get, just because there aren't enough hours in their day. Or when a person goes out in public and there are strangers asking for interactions with you with a lack of an interpersonal relationship.<br /><br />We all have a tendency to seek out the attention and validation of famous people, who are, by definition, the people who are least likely to be able to give it to us. Perhaps that's why we seek it out and want it so badly...it's scarce. <br /><br />If you read a book lately that wasn't a New York Times bestseller, and you liked it, consider sending the author an email and telling them. Post a comment on a few blogs that resonated with you. I do this at random, and it's not about reciprocity. It would be easy for me to stick the URL for this blog into the "Your Website" field on the comment form, but I'm not interested in doing that. <br /><br />Think of it as a gift.
