                      In the film What About Bob, one of the characters is a psychiatrist (Richard Dreyfuss) who takes on a new patient (Bill Murray) who ends up being quite a handful. The doctor is the author of a (fictional) book called Baby Steps, which he gives to all of his patients. It encourages a mindset on the part of the patient to take things in life in small chunks, to avoid being overwhelmed by reality.On the...

                      One of my favorite quotes comes from Galileo, who once said, "You cannot teach a man anything...you can only help him find it within himself." For instructional teaching, this maxim probably doesn't apply. I don't imagine any of us are born with the knowledge of how a car works...hence, the manual in driver's ed. Where it does hold true is for inspirational teaching, or the teaching of general truths about the world.I actually don't think...

                      When you're watching television and you see a man getting hit in the groin, you feel their pain. As the observer, your gut clenches up and you bend over, almost as if you yourself had been hit. On a logical level, you know you're not in any danger, but your brain still reacts as though what you're witnessing is actually happening to you.Scientists call the cells in our brain responsible for driving these kinds of...

                      If you're selling toilet paper to everyone in the world, you probably need to be pretty politically correct. When a Charmin ultra commercial comes on, you're doomed, because the message is going to be watered down, uninteresting, and crafted to speak to the widest possible audience. They want everyone to buy their toilet paper.I'm not convinced this is the correct approach. Here's a video created by Lane Bryant that's making fun of Victoria's Secret commercials,...

                      In cinema-speak, a logline is basically an elevator pitch. It's a one-sentence summary of plot of the movie you want to write. If you're a screenwriter running around desperately trying to get someone in Hollywood to listen to your story idea, you'd better have a worthwhile (and short) logline that embodies the essence of the story you want to tell.Here's the one for Die Hard: "A New York cop visits his estranged wife in LA...

                      In the movie Amadeus, Antonio Salieri recounts his life in his old age, his love of music, and his hatred of a composer named Mozart. Mozart, he claimed, was always able to create better music than he, and it drove Salieri crazy because he so desperately wanted to create great music. Yet, he lived in the shadow of this young musical prodigy, who was so much more adept at composing and for whom it seemed...

                      I play Texas Hold 'em in a casino for the first time in a very long time. It was very surreal being surrounded by a bunch of strangers, who are all being very polite to one another but battling for chips, and all the while I'm trying to use everything that I had read in poker books in the heat of the moment. I can see why people develop a habit of playing poker.There's a...

                      When asked about how he built his steel empire and managed to turn over three dozen people he had hired to work for him into millionaires (quite an accomplishment for the 1930's), Andrew Carnegie replied:"Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. But you don't go into the mine looking for the dirt."Wise words coming from one of the most successful...

                      I went looking for a combination lock at the local grocery store, like the ones we all had to buy in middle school for our lockers. I found this lock sitting right by the typical three-number combination lock.Here's how it works: you put your thumb on the round lump in the center, and you can slide it one of four directions: up, down, left, and right. (Easy.) In order to open it, you slide it...
