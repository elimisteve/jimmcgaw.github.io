                      I can say that about him on here, because he hates the Internet (he once called it a "bunch of noise"), so I'm pretty sure he'll never read this. The author of the dystopian Fahrenheit 451 once stood up to discuss the book in an auditorium full of students. He tried to explain to them that the main theme of his book was about the evils of television. The students insisted, repeatedly, that the book...

                      And so begins the holiday season, which brings Santa to town, eggnog spiked with too much rum, and a festive new slew of advertisements. This is the time of year when people tend to stop shopping for themselves and begin shopping for others, but it still seems like the right time of year for a little experiment. The way ads and TV commercials run, it seems a lot of marketers believe that human beings are...

                      Last year, I posted the following on my Facebook page on the day before Thanksgiving:"My employer offered me the afternoon off. Four hours for which I'm getting paid but doing nothing. Taking my wages for that time to the grocery store, buying that much food, and dropping it off at the local food bank. Namaste."At the time, it seemed like an interesting thing to do, and I posted that I was doing it not because...

                      I was listening to a friend talk to me about the school systems in the state of California which, he insisted, were getting worse. He pointed at this at one example of how life has gotten worse for the middle class over the past fifty years.I responded to this by asking him, "Do you think it's possible to look at the last fifty years and conclude that life has gotten better for the middle class...

                      It's been established, time and time again, that people who keep a positive mental attitude outperform those with negative mental attitudes in almost every endeavor. Which begs the obvious question: why do so many intelligent people cling so tightly to a gloom-and-doom view on life?I think one of the primary reasons is that negativity fits better in a social context, for a couple of reasons. It's very easy to rally people around commiseration, because it...

                      My friend Jina shared this quote with me: ‎"When people ask me: 'Norm, how do you feel about stem cell research?' I say: 'Why don't I just go to the University of Science for 10 years and then come back to this very spot and tell you what those three words mean. Because I don't know.'" - Norm MacDonaldNorm points out a very common human weakness: that we tend to assume we know more than...

                      I responded to a job post recently that was asking for people who are experts in a handful of different specialties. I understand what they're asking for, but I have a particular bone to pick with the word "expert". Two things:First, people always tend to assume they know more than they think they do. It's a neat little trick our egos play on us to make life bearable. Even right out of the gate, we...

                      Clearly, blogs are a powerful medium through which people can offer ideas, at little or no cost to themselves, to as wide of an audience as is willing to read them. But blogs have a bad reputation because in their early days, a lot of people treated them as online diaries. For lots of people, a negative impression formed, as the result of the self-expression and self-importance that characterized the posts on LiveJournal.But it's not...

                      "Rule of law" is a legal term referring to the concept that no sovereign should be above the law. In other words, the President of the United States should be held accountable for the same crimes he commits as any other citizen of this country.I've met my fair share of people who are still furious with Bill Clinton and the fact that he got away with perjury without being impeached. Perhaps it doesn't always work...
