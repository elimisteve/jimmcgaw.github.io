        And so begins the holiday season, which brings Santa to town, eggnog spiked with too much rum, and a festive new slew of advertisements. This is the time of year when people tend to stop shopping for themselves and begin shopping for others, but it still seems like the right time of year for a little experiment. <br /><br />The way ads and TV commercials run, it seems a lot of marketers believe that human beings are little fact-processing machines. I'm constantly amazed by how many ads proclaim a superior product or service over their competitors, as though consumers would be receptive to facts and consider switching their brands.<br /><br />Don't drink Coke; drink Pepsi.<br /><br />Truth is, people don't think through (small) purchase decisions like rational creatures. We're all too busy for that. When we shop for groceries,  we generally buy what we've always bought. We buy the same cereal, same soda, and same brand of raisins, time after time.<br /><br />We shop out of habit, not thought.<br /><br />Habit is a powerful force, and it drives most of what we do each and every day, and this (not advertising) in turn drives most brand loyalty. So here's an idea: for a month, try being brand adverse instead of brand loyal. Yep, you always go to Starbucks, but try going to a few different coffee shops and ordering your drink <em>du rigeur</em>. Get Tecate instead of Corona. Look at your own habits and try to shake them up.<br /><br />If you do it for a month, chances are good you'll fall back into your usual rut, but it does offer perspective. You may fall into some new habits, too.

        I hear this stuff all the time. <br /><br />"Of course he's happy...he's rich. If I were rich, I'd be happy too."<br /><br />"Of course she's happy...she found the perfect husband. If I were married to that guy, I'd be happy too."<br /><br />"Of course he's happy...he's got the best job in the company. If I had that job, I'd be on easy street."<br /><br />Strangely, if you challenge people in these kinds of statements, they'll get defensive. They'll start crafting arguments about how unlucky they are, and how much better others have it than them. They insist that they'd be happy if the universe gave them a little more than what they already have.<br /><br />Excuses are a funny thing; they're like a verbal form of cognitive dissonance. We fabricate excuses as a means of justifying aloud a conclusion we've already reached. Many people make excuses about why they should be miserable. Others make excuses about why they should be grateful.<br /><br />I've noticed that people in higher positions, or with more wealth, tend to be more grateful for what they have. I wonder what comes first...those accolades, or the gratitude?

      <div class="content">
        Last year, I posted the following on my Facebook page on the day before Thanksgiving:<br /><br />"My employer offered me the afternoon off. Four hours for which I'm getting paid but doing nothing. Taking my wages for that time to the grocery store, buying that much food, and dropping it off at the local food bank. Namaste."<br /><br />At the time, it seemed like an interesting thing to do, and I posted that I was doing it not because I wanted to toot my own horn so much as I wanted to trickle the idea into social media. <br /><br />It's a simple idea, really: employers give their staff time off, and they pay it forward in some fashion. A much more common thing for the employees to do instead of purchasing donations with their wages is to volunteer their time.<br /><br />I mentioned this idea to a friend of mine, and she told me, "That's not a bad thought. Big companies have been doing things like that for years, but the problem is, they're all disappearing now." Since I live in California, a land teeming with start-up ventures, this is one point that resonated with me.<br /><br />Start-ups might be a little too resource-starved to send off their labor to volunteer at non-profits, but somewhere between them and huge companies like Walmart lies an assortment of small- to medium-sized retailers, service businesses, and private practices. Surely some of them could afford to give up their employees for a few days out of the year. <br /><br />If these businesses insist on doing it to get something in return, here's some bullet point benefits (made up by me):<br /><br />1. Good publicity<br />2. Employee satisfaction (less turnover)<br />3. Team building<br />4. Tax breaks (?)<br /><br />For smaller companies, I think this makes a lot of sense. At least allow your employees to try this once. Giving is a powerful feeling, and I think a lot of people would be more willing to try it for the first time if they could do it at the expense of their employer.<br /><br />Failing all of this, it's something to keep in mind if you get to go home from work early today.

        I was listening to a friend talk to me about the school systems in the state of California which, he insisted, were getting worse. He pointed at this at one example of how life has gotten worse for the middle class over the past fifty years.<br /><br />I responded to this by asking him, "Do you think it's possible to look at the last fifty years and conclude that life has gotten <em>better</em> for the middle class instead of worse?"<br /><br />He shrugged and offered a rather lucid, insightful response: "Well, it depends how you measure it."<br /><br />Recently, I read a book that claimed a study found that teenagers who listen to music that contains predominantly minor chords are more intelligent than those who listen to "happier" music with major chords. I have no doubt in my mind that this study offered accurate results that support that conclusion. But how did they gauge the intelligence of each teen? And how many minor chords are we talking about?<br /><br />Data isn't the end-all, be-all of reaching a final conclusion, but in dealing with assumptions based on broad, general trends, maybe it helps to stop and ask, "How am I measuring this?"

        It's been established, time and time again, that people who keep a positive mental attitude outperform those with negative mental attitudes in almost every endeavor. Which begs the obvious question: why do so many intelligent people cling so tightly to a gloom-and-doom view on life?<br /><br />I think one of the primary reasons is that negativity fits better in a social context, for a couple of reasons. It's very easy to rally people around commiseration, because it makes for more interesting conversation. We bond over mutual dislikes and common enemies. Linux culture was almost certainly born out of dissatisfaction, and it was nurtured into maturity by a collective hatred of Bill Gates and Microsoft.<br /><br />The reason that negativity is more "sticky" in our culture might have something to do with the fact that we're taught to be so positive. My upbringing wasn't strict, and I had great parents, but I was taught to tell "white lies" in social situations. That is, even if you're unhappy or don't like something, you should put on a happy face and endure, if for no other reason than to spare the other person's feelings. Most of us learn this at some point when we're young.<br /><br />But then something happens in our adolescence. Maybe it's a substitute teacher in our sixth grade English class who stands up and bores the entire class to tears for 35 minutes with a speech. And because you've been taught to smile, nod, and pretend you're interested, that's what you do.<br /><br />Then, as you're leaving the class, one of your fellow classmates says to you, "Man, that guy was <em>boring</em>." The honesty breaks through the facade, and suddenly, there's a connection between you two. It's liberating. You're suddenly allowed to express how you really feel, you've bonded with another human being, and maybe this feeling alone, in this context, is powerful enough to create a positive association to commiseration in our minds.<br /><br />Me, I think if you're going to insist on rallying people around something to hate, at least do what the Linux people did: spin it into something positive and <em>create</em> something with it.

        My friend Jina shared this quote with me: <br /><br />‎"When people ask me: 'Norm, how do you feel about stem cell research?' I say: 'Why don't I just go to the University of Science for 10 years and then come back to this very spot and tell you what those three words mean. Because I don't know.'" - Norm MacDonald<br /><br />Norm points out a very common human weakness: that we tend to assume we know more than we actually do. Our brains are funny things; we're possess an awareness of our beliefs and the world around us, but we tend to lack a <em>meta-awareness</em>, or, put another way, an awareness of our awareness.<br /><br />Take the ongoing and tedious debate about evolution versus creationism: the debate itself is a social construct. It could not possibly occur in a civilization of one or two people. There's no single piece of evidence that points to evolution; lots of scientists and small bits of evidence can be constructed to make an arrow that points in that direction. People who aren't evolutionary biologists (and probably some who are) ultimately have to decide they trust the efforts of these scientists enough to believe this conclusion. For a creationist, the problem is the same: none of us have any direct experience with the origins of the universe, but there's a very authoritative 2,000-year-old book that describes its conception, and we ultimately have to decide if they have enough faith in this book to believe this conclusion.<br /><br />Our opinions on this topic (and lots of other complicated ones) are not based on our own experience, but on the collective observations, conjectures, speculation, and theories of other many other people. You probably know that atoms are constructed of clumps of protons and neutrons with electrons in orbit around them. But: ever see this for yourself?<br /><br />Looking at it this way, the question shifts from "Who's right?" to "Who am I choosing to believe, and why?"

        I responded to a job post recently that was asking for people who are experts in a handful of different specialties. I understand what they're asking for, but I have a particular bone to pick with the word "expert". Two things:<br /><br />First, people always tend to assume they know more than they think they do. It's a neat little trick our egos play on us to make life bearable. Even right out of the gate, we assume we know more than we think we do. So asking for experts doesn't necessarily eliminate all of the unqualified applicants.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, the more expert a person is, the less likely they are to refer to themselves as an expert. Part of being a true expert, in any field, is being able to clearly see what you don't know. Expertise is a journey, not a goal, and people who are on the right path know how much further they have to venture.<br /><br />An expert isn't someone without limits; they're a person who starts with an awareness of their own limitations and goes from there.

        Clearly, blogs are a powerful medium through which people can offer ideas, at little or no cost to themselves, to as wide of an audience as is willing to read them. But blogs have a bad reputation because in their early days, a lot of people treated them as online diaries. For lots of people, a negative impression formed, as the result of the self-expression and self-importance that characterized the posts on LiveJournal.<br /><br />But it's not just an opportunity to talk; it's also an opportunity to lead. Since anybody can have a voice now, and attract an audience by producing content at little or no cost to themselves, it's worth taking a shot.<br /><br />One of the classic books on marketing is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071373586/">Positioning</a>. I really like this book because it's a quick, easy read, and it re-enforces all of its points using examples of big-name companies you've heard of. It articulates a lot of concepts about what works and what doesn't. Once you read it, you'll never watch television commercials the same way again. Personally, I'm stunned that the book makes such compelling arguments, and that now, 30 years after its publication, so many companies are still making the mistakes that the authors caution against.<br /><br />Where was I. Ah, yes...if you don't want to read the book, here's the most important point from the book: when you enter any market, <em>be first</em>.<br /><br />Simple, but most people get this wrong. When you look at the history of any product, it's the company or brand that came first to which all of the benefits accrue. The imitations that follow tend to struggle, and usually end up (at best) second to the player who got there first. Think Coca-Cola (the original cola), Xerox (the original copy machine), NyQuil (the original nighttime cold medicine), McDonald's (the original fast food joint), and Polaroid (the original instant photograph).<br /><br />There are exceptions to this, of course. Google wasn't the first search engine, and Facebook wasn't the first social network. There's still something to be said for strategy and execution.<br /><br />But "being first" is very difficult for most people. It's really only useful advice if you're starting from zero, but let's face it...that's exactly where most of us are. And given a blank sheet of paper, an empty canvas to fill, most of us choose to follow and do what's been done before. <br /><br />Why? Because being first, and being original, takes more than vision; it also takes guts. It reveals vulnerability, and so it's a risky proposition.<br /><br />David Meerman Scott writes that by establishing yourself as an expert on the Internet, by producing useful and interesting content for an audience, you become a "thought leader". I like this phrase. You might not be the first person to try doing something, but maybe your approach, or style of execution, is what some people need to hear.<br /><br />Go start something. There's no shortage of new ideas, but there's a big shortage of people who are bold enough to go first.

        "Rule of law" is a legal term referring to the concept that no sovereign should be above the law. In other words, the President of the United States should be held accountable for the same crimes he commits as any other citizen of this country.<br /><br />I've met my fair share of people who are still furious with Bill Clinton and the fact that he got away with perjury without being impeached. Perhaps it doesn't always work when it comes to enforcing the law...may the client with the best attorney win, in other words.<br /><br />Our politicians shouldn't be above the law, but I don't think a single elected official should be above humility. This isn't just about the President pitching the first baseball at the opening of the season; it's something deeper than that. It's about demonstrating that the power you hold over those you govern is a privilege, not a right, and about living each day to earn it. <br /><br />Ross Perot once said that he never delegated any task that he himself had never done, or wasn't willing to do himself. When you become a leader, perhaps you should put away childish things...but constantly remind yourself that you're not above them, either.

        Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell, most people have heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a>, or the notion that a small, seemingly insignificant sign of decay, disrepair, or apathy can end up having a big impact. A single broken window, if left unfixed, gives people the impression that the neighborhood is in decline, and this changes people's behavior. It can theoretically lead to more "broken windows".<br /><br />But it's not the broken window that does it. It's the <em>perception</em> that the window creates in peoples' minds. <br /><br />The state of the windows themselves don't matter so much as the attitude of the people that have to live with them. Every single window in a building could be broken, but if everyone in the neighborhood decided to go about their days as though this wasn't a problem, it would keep things from declining.<br /><br />If there's a broken window, but someone is brave enough to make a joke about it, or can make light of the issue in a way that communicates to passersby that people still care, maybe the downward spiral can be slowed a little bit. <br /><br />We live in a world full of broken windows. While it would probably be best if we fixed all of them, maybe the second best option is to stop thinking they matter so much, or to fix the negative impression they leave on people.
