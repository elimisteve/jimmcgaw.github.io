        Today my blog is saying goodbye to Facebook.<br /><br />A year ago today, I decided to do one very simple thing: write a blog post once a day for a year.<br /><br />It's a year later, and I managed to do it. (Phew!) I really like writing, and generally, there's not shortage of idea running through my head, so I honestly didn't think I'd have any trouble coming up with 365 little brain dumps.<br /><br />The second part was something I was a little more conflicted about: I fed the RSS feed of my blog into my personal Facebook account, so that every morning, all my friends would see it.<br /><br />I actually didn't take this decision lightly. The idea occurred to me, and I liked the idea because I'd never heard of anyone doing it before. But actually doing it seemed like a bad idea.<br /><br />There's a very simple reason: attention is the scarcest resource any of us have. Asking people to look at something I've written once a day isn't trivial; it's asking a whole lot of people. Every day, when I hit the "Publish" button, I would freak out just a little bit inside for fear that eventually, a bunch of people would call me out on being an arrogant showboater.<br /><br />People were actually nicer than expected about it. All the feedback I got was positive. To all of you: thanks. <br /><br />A few people asked me why I did it. And the answer is important, because it's not what most people think. I didn't feed my blog into Facebook in order to get people reading it. Some people did, and I'm grateful they did, but that kind of shameless self-promotion doesn't scale, and if you're a blogger, tapping your online social network is no way to build an audience.<br /><br /><strong>I didn't do it because I wanted people to read <em>what</em> I was writing. I did it because I wanted people to see <em>that</em> I was writing.</strong><br /><br />I was hoping at least one person might see my daily posts and think, "Well, Jim's finding the time to write all those posts every day...now that I think about it, maybe I have time to do something of my own." The best way to inspire others is to lead by doing, to do something grand, to make an ass of yourself trying to do something grand, to be playful, to try new things, to fail out loud, to live out loud, to <em>be enthusiastic</em>.<br /><br />I think everyone should have a blog, and everyone should write once a day. Even if no one reads it. Even if you suck at writing. The mere act of writing changes you, and it leads your brain down creative paths and sparks ideas that wouldn't have emerged otherwise. Blogging becomes not just about what you believe, but about what you can articulate and defend.<br /><br />Considering that half the country is snowed in at the moment, there's no better time to start. Find an itch. Go back through the past year's worth of ideas on here, find something you disagree with me on, and write a blog post about how you think I'm wrong. (Don't make it about me, though. Formulate a response to my <em>idea</em>, not to me. Write it to make it your own.) Then tomorrow, write about something else. The important thing is, whatever you do, <em>don't stop</em>. The fountain of youth is movement.<br /><br />As to this blog, going forward, I'm not sure how regular I'm going to write. I can't promise I'll post every day. And for those of you still want to read my stuff in your Facebook feed, I created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jim-McGaws-Blog/148526491870147">Facebook page for this blog here</a>, which you're welcome to "Like" if you please.<br /><br />Thanks for your time and attention. And by the way, there is a very fine line between showboating and exhibiting enthusiasm. Coming across as arrogant is always a risk, but I think it's a line well worth learning to tread on.

        Over the Christmas break, I had a discussion with my mom about the public library in the town where I grew up in Michigan. Last I heard, because of a lack of funds and the most recent election, its doors are closing for good in June of this year. I was interesting in brainstorming about ways in which the library's fate might be stopped or, at the very least, stalled for a while.<br /><br />I'm always interested in these kinds of talks. Given the town where I grew up, I'm sure the people on the board of directors of the library are creative, but there's a limit to what they're allowed to do. And the members of the city council probably weren't trying too hard to imagine ways to save the library.<br /><br />So, are there any guerrilla publicity tactics that could be used by an independent, passionate citizen to generate some attention and possibly keep the library open?<br /><br />After throwing around a few random ideas, though, we eventually got around to asking a pretty important question: should we even bother trying to save the library?<br /><br />I'm aware that there are groups of people who rely on the library as a place to use the Internet, get books and magazines, and go to study before large exams. But when I started to think about the library itself, from a utilitarian perspective, maybe it's not worth the money it would take to keep it open.<br /><br />This sounds like a radical thought (or an ultra-conservative one, if you please), but if you think about most public libraries, their function hasn't changed a whole lot over the past century. The way they're organized, the check-out policies and late fees, customer service...no public library I've ever been in has been a beacon for innovation. If they weren't a publicly-funded utility, and were instead a for-profit business reliant on customer loyalty, most libraries are slow-moving dinosaurs that would have been wiped out ages ago. (See also: the post office.)<br /><br />Maybe the net benefit to society as a whole doesn't outweigh the what they're costing. I pose that question as someone who truly, deeply hates bean counters. I'm not talking strictly about dollars and cents here. Maybe the utility afforded the public by a public library isn't always worth the trouble that goes into it. Maybe its an inefficient system that's outdated and needs to be overhauled. The question of a cost-benefit comparison is often overshadowed by the insistence of sticklers for tradition, even in the absence of any actual good reason.<br /><br />The library is in trouble in part because of the rise of alternatives to physical books: namely, the Internet and e-readers. I'm not saying the Internet replaces the library for everyone. But what happens when the Kindle becomes a commodity and you can go to Goodwill and buy a used one for ten bucks? What does the world look like in ten years from now?<br /><br />And one other problem with staying mired into tradition, with keeping things as is, is that it means that the status quo doesn't get out of the way and let something else take its place. If the library closes, then maybe that means society eventually, after adjusting itself, moves forward.<br /><br />I'm not saying this is a <em>good</em> thing. The sudden hole where the library system used to be is going to be a pain point for hundreds of people. But in that gap lies opportunity. Like most government systems, the operational effectiveness of the library was always merely "good enough". If someone had the bright idea of making the library look more like Netflix for books, as a way of saving overhead, no one at the city would have gone for it, because it's too weird of an idea. It's not conventional enough.<br /><br />I'm not saying good riddance to the library. If you live in Troy and can save the library from closing, I encourage you to run, not walk, in doing so. But I'm a fatalist, and if it's going to happen anyway, I'm curious who's going to stand up and do something in the aftermath.

        If you're looking to buy a house, it makes a big difference where you are. A good rule of thumb is to favor a small house on a good street over a big house in a sketchy neighborhood. Geography matters.<br /><br />The first lesson that the Internet ever taught me, way back 15 years ago while I was still connecting to AOL on my parent's dial-up connection, was that geography was going to matter less and less in the coming years. I remember the AOL chat rooms being like a social sandbox, where I was free to say whatever I wanted without many consequences. If I messed up, I just went someplace else. It was a like a big red do-over button.<br /><br />I remember stumbling across a Geocities page of some fellow teenager in Tennessee in 1998 discussing his fondness for one of my favorite bands. He wrote, "If it weren't for their music, and me sitting alone in my room listening to their albums with my headphones on for hours, I might have gone nuts in tenth grade." It was odd, because the more I read, the more I started to think the words on the screen could have been written by me.<br /><br />Part of it was that the Internet afforded the writer anonymity. But on that day, reading that person's thoughts, I realized that I wasn't special. I thought I was, because I was attending high school with hundreds of people I believed I didn't have anything in common with. But seeing all these people on the Internet thinking the same thoughts as me was somewhat alarming, because I valued what I thought was my individuality.<br /><br />Time was, you were confined to the people with whom you were going to school. 5th grade was like that. I knew the 20 other kids in class, and more on the playground, but that was about it. I couldn't plug in and chat with someone else like me halfway around the world just by turning on a computer. Now, you can, and almost everyone does, every day.<br /><br />I realized that going forward, as the Internet got bigger, being a unique individual was going to get harder and harder. Over a decade later, that seems even more true now. There are thousands of people with blogs just like mine, thousands of people that tweet like me, who like the same music, and so on. This has its upsides; each of us can know, just by Googling a bit, that we're not alone in the universe.<br /><br />And yet, I wonder if that omni-present reassurance we can get from cyberspace has any downsides?

        I mentioned to my friend Greg that I was trying to learn how to draw better. He gave me a very good piece of advice: don't worry about drawing better. Just draw more.<br /><br />There's a chasm between the luck and drive of a beginner, and the skill and finesse of an expert. Somewhere in this gap, there's a frustration that stems from knowing you can or should do better before you're fully capable. It's demotivating...and it's one of the main things that separates serious workers from the tourists.<br /><br />We're always creating the hindsight. The past we can look upon and recognize how much better we've gotten. The more there is, the better.

        I'll concede one very simple point: the houses you see on "Hoarders" can be pretty creepy.<br /><br />Personally, I think the people portrayed on these shows are on the fringes. They are people who have gradually learned to live at one extreme. I really don't think anyone should base their lifestyle around tons of clutter.<br /><br />But it does amaze me that they counter these extremes by bringing in people at the other extreme. The <a href="http://www.napo.net/survey.php">National Association of Professional Organizers</a> (NAPO) is comprised of people who seem to think that everything in the world should be stacked, categorized, filed, and organized neatly. To have an appearance to the contrary is supposedly a sign of a tremendous character flaw.<br /><br />Of course they'd say that; for an hourly consulting fee, you can hire them to help you organize your home or office.<br /><br />As a culture, we seem to have a compulsion with putting things in order, and taking great pains to maintain that order. Given that the natural order of the universe seems to be disorganized and messy, I'd say this is pretty odd.<br /><br />There is a critical distinction between <em>clutter</em> and <em>filth</em>. Personally, I take pains to keep dust from accruing and mold from blooming. But my apartment and my desk at work are not strangers to disorganized heaps of papers, books, and other goodies.<br /><br />Or so they would appear. One thing about mess is that it's subjective. I tend to keep a pretty messy <em>looking</em> desk, but the stacks of papers are sorted. The items of higher priority tend to gravitate toward the top, and I tend to know where they exist relative to each other. If someone else had to find something on my desk, they would probably have to go through the entire stack to find it.<br /><br />The alternative, of course, is to get a folder rack, put the documents into folders, and keep them in there. This certainly organizes every by categories...but who's to say the categories aren't arbitrary? Would anyone else with no knowledge of my organization system be able to find something with greater ease than the aimless stacks?<br /><br />In short, one man's mess is another man's order. This isn't that big of a surprise. The majority of couples report that the state of their shared living space is a common cause of fights. This has certainly been true for me in all my past living arrangements; I seem to have a higher tolerance of clutter than a lot of people. And I've met people who I think keep some pretty disgusting lifestyle habits. Eye of the beholder, I suppose.<br /><br />Objectively, I'm not sure where the line should be drawn (or if it even ought to be drawn), but it is true that keeping constant order has one major drawback: it takes effort. And it's definitely arguable that past a certain point, diminishing returns kick in and the extra effort stops being worth the trouble.<br /><br />So it's a trade-off: time versus tidy. And like most people, I'm so short on time that I'll be damned if I'm going to let some obsessive compulsive neat freak tell me I need to spend a healthy portion of it keeping my life in order.

        In the security field, it really doesn't matter how much you know about security. You can read every book their is on penetration testing, cryptography, or computer cracking. Take in all the theory you want, but it will only take you so far in securing computers networks or organizations from attackers.<br /><br />It's not what you've managed to secure...it's what you've managed to break into.<br /><br />Kevin Mitnick is a highly sought after expert on cracking the human weaknesses in systems, a field called <em>social engineering</em>. He didn't get to that position merely by studying microexpressions or poker tells; he got there by breaking into places. He learned how to infiltrate large organizations and bypass their security by becoming a bullshit artist. (He did spend some time in prison because of this.)<br /><br />It's one thing to learn cautiously and build slowly, but what have you broken?

        I was walking through one of those "alternative" grocery stores that are so popular here in Southern California called Lazy Acres (basically, a Whole Foods clone) looking for Cilantro-flavored toothpaste. (Don't worry, I didn't actually find it.) I was wandering aimlessly through the aisles, and it struck me that I was having difficulty finding the toothpaste <em>section</em>.<br /><br />This is unusual for me. If I go into a mainstream retailer like CVS, Target, or Ralph's, I'm going to scan the isles from the end, spot the toothpaste section very quickly, and make a beeline for it.<br /><br />Why, then, was it so difficult to spot the aisle containing the toothpaste at this other store?<br /><br />I realized it was because, in the absence of any major brands, there were no visual cues about where things should be. If you're walking around CVS looking for cold medicine, chances are good you'll spot the NyQuil bottles from a distance. The familiar green bottle stands out. And you can safely expect the other cold medicines to be located pretty close to it.<br /><br />In this store, all of the boxes looked the same. I've got nothing against Tom's of Maine, but their packaging is not distinct in any way. Neither are the others. The colors are bland, so all the toothpastes look about the same if you're just scanning. And more importantly, just by scanning, you can't tell the boxes of toothpaste from the boxes of hemorrhoid cream. About the only way to do this is to lean in and read the words on the package.<br /><br />I'm a savvy shopper. It's typical of most males, but I'm accustomed to getting in, getting what I need, and getting out quickly. My brain is full of heuristics that enable me to streamline this process. If I get tripped up, I'm going to get slightly frustrated, probably blame the store, and leave. Even if I find what I came for, it's one of those tiny events that, in aggregate with other things, can turn a good day into a bad one.<br /><br />In general, I'm perfectly capable of learning, and I'm willing to learn, new heuristics...but they <em>do</em> have to be there.

        Everyone seems to have an answer to this question. Here's mine:<br /><br />Good ideas come from the expansive meadows of the mind where multitudes of bad ideas have just as much freedom to run around as the good ones.<br /><br />Your brain is always trying its hardest. If you dismiss all bad ideas at the outset, then your brain learns its lesson and stops speaking up. You're biting the hand that's trying to feed you.<br /><br />Ideate now, filter later.

        Nope, I'm not joking. Here's your chance. It's a relatively new medium that's slowly being adopted by a large group of people who decided they wanted to start reading books on an e-reader. <br /><br />Traditional publishers have long since discovered that they can make money by publishing their print books in the Kindle format and knocking off a few dollars. I'm not talking about doing that. If you have a full-length book, sure, I think you should publish it...but there's a more compelling proposition.<br /><br />Write short books. Make them about 20 or 30 pages in length. They can be about whatever you want to write about, but preferably, it's a discipline you're already fairly knowledgeable about or skilled at. And then self-publish the content on Amazon as a Kindle book, for $2 or $3.<br /><br />Some authors, in some categories, are already testing these waters. One of my favorite writers on non-verbal communication releases short Kindle books that cost around $4 a piece.<br /><br />What's the upside? With self-published Kindle books, the author isn't at the mercy of the Random House or Oxford. If you have an idea, it's already good enough, provided someone out there wants to read it. You get to keep most of what comes in...last time I checked, the author receives 70% of the revenue. Length of the book matters less, since you don't need to fill a whole book before trying to bring the idea to market. Start small, test, see what works, and repeat as necessary.<br /><br />Is this a good idea? I don't know...it remains largely untested because traditional book publishers are dependent on books being long enough to fill at least one or two hundred pages. I don't expect them to start encouraging authors or writers to start producing smaller Kindle books anytime soon. But why bother waiting for them to get with the times? The lower price definitely has an appeal, especially if you're an unknown author, because people are willing to take more chances with $2 or $3...more so than with $15.<br /><br />There's one caveat, and for some people, it's be a big one: you really need to know HTML in order to format the books. I've heard lots of authors interested in writing Kindle books lament: "It's too much HTML for me to handle." So, it's not for everyone. But most people I've met have done at least <em>some</em> HTML, either at work or for a personal project. And if you can write something in Microsoft Word, you can generally save the document as HTML and squeak by all right. So I don't think it's a stretch to say that it's a possibility for a lot of people.<br /><br />Forty years ago, any writer living on bread and water and scotch would have killed for the opportunity to make use of a new platform like the Kindle, to skirt the publishers with their "REJECTED" stamps, and to reach and build an audience organically. I'm not saying it's a quick road to riches, and it's not the easiest thing in the world...but for anyone who's writing, it can't hurt to give it a shot, at least once.<br /><br />As Zig Ziglar points out, a dime and a $50 gold piece have the exact same value, if they're both corroding at the bottom of the ocean. Go bring something to the surface.

        There are several words used in dialects around the world that don't have a direct translation into English. I find these cases interesting, since they belie a cultural difference. There are concepts that exist in other parts of the world, to which they've dedicated a word, but we haven't acknowledged them to that extent in English. How, exactly, is that possible?<br /><br />The great thing about the German language is that it's permissible to form new words simply by concatenating several shorter words. Here's one: Torschlusspanik. Literally translated, it means "gate-closing panic", in reference to the fear of diminishing opportunities as one ages.<br /><br />The time to panic about how little time each of us is given, of course, is not when it dawns on you that you're getting older. The time to panic is right now, while you still have plenty of time.
