        It's very difficult to get someone's attention or generate interest with a single tweet or blog post. <br /><br />I have almost 200 posts on here now, and each one is a potential landing page. That means each post is a potential first impression for anyone who is stumbling blindly around the Internet looking for something, and happens to click a link that leads to one of my posts.<br /><br />Most of them probably won't stick around for long, or ever come back, for that matter. In all fairness, any one of my posts is probably not worth much on its own. But I'd like to think that, taken in aggregate, I might be able to persuade (trick) a person who's reading my posts into looking at the world a slightly different way, or make them approach a problem in their own lives slightly differently. <br /><br />Perhaps I'd have a lot more success if each of my posts was written outrageously, and hooked in all readers in the first paragraph. But I doubt I'd be able to do that every day, and more importantly, people who aren't looking to read more than one or two paragraphs aren't really part of the audience that I'm writing for.<br /><br />Of all the people who find this blog, maybe only 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 bother to stick around and spend some time absorbing the essence of my writing. Those are the people for whom I'm writing, and everyone else represents the limit of what I can accomplish by writing on here. I'm okay with this, because I think I'll have a bigger impact on those few people's minds than I would by creating "wow!" content that would captivate everyone else for a few brief seconds.<br /><br />What that means is that, as a reader, I try to spend some time getting to know a person before I decide whether or not I'm interested in what they have to say. It's easier to quickly jump to conclusions given a small amount of information than it is to aggregate and make sense of lots of stuff.

        Jed Simon, a guitar player in one of my favorite bands, was talking about how he writes songs as they come to him and then, after the fact, he shoehorns them into all kinds of different projects that he's working on.<br /><br />That's a great idea. It's similar in concept to picking an outlet. Once you've determined how you're going to unleash yourself onto the world, create logical groupings within that outlet. Cluster what you create, and send the different groupings to different audiences.<br /><br />If I were to sit down and commit to writing one song per week for an entire year, I'd have 52 songs at the end of the year. Given my lack of attention span, they wouldn't all fit together. Some would be loud and heavy, and others would be soft acoustic guitar ballads with the flute spattered all over them. One would have the rhythm of a samba, and another one would be a waltz with loops of bumblebees on it. (I'm making this stuff up, hypothetically.)<br /><br />Of all this dross, there would probably be one album of decent material on there. Twelve songs that are worth sharing with people. And in the world of fifteen years ago, I could take the 40 songs that are left over and use the better tracks as B-sides on singles that would cost $13.99 each as imports from the UK that die-hard fans would buy. Back when people actually cared about what he was doing, this is exactly what Billy Corgan did with The Smashing Pumpkins (pre-<em>Adore</em>.)<br /><br />That reveals another problem with making art: you have to generate a lot of noise to get the signal. If you're lucky enough to be overflowing with natural talent, maybe the ratio would be lower. For the rest of us, persistence and volume are the key.

        The guy who started eBay began the whole idea by selling a broken laser pointer, which, to his astonishment, someone actually bought from him. Surprised, he contacted the buyer directly and asked him, "You realize that the laser pointer is <em>broken</em>, right?"<br /><br />"Sure," the buyer replied. "I collect broken laser pointers."<br /><br />In hindsight, this strikes a person with the "Who Woulda Thunk?" syndrome. As it turns out, that can be a pretty good competitive advantage. I suspect that one of main reasons eBay got such a head start in the online auction market is because no potential competitors ever took the whole idea seriously until eBay had won the branding war and owned most of that market. In other words, until it was too late.<br /><br />Following through on a "bad" idea or trying to sell something that "nobody" wants to buy might just work to your own advantage.

        I have complained in a few prior posts about the quality of coffee that auto maintenance places offer to the people sitting around in their cramped and uncomfortable waiting rooms. It seems like spending a few extra bucks for a decent coffee machine and decent coffee is pretty low-hanging fruit, as far as things you can do to keep customers happy while you're working on their car.<br /><br />I went to a local Jiffy Lube recently to get my oil changed. I've been there three or four times in the past, but this time, there was a new coffee machine sitting in the corner:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S6QEqQAcxPI/AAAAAAAAAKY/k-HHQFBszt0/s200/0319001319.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450486572923012338" /><br /><br />This contraption takes little single plastic packaged cups of group coffee. You put one in the top, put a cup under the spout, hit brew, and it spits out a small cup of freshly brewed coffee. The grounds weren't top of the line, and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to actually use the damn machine (there weren't instructions, so I just started pushing buttons half expecting to break it.) But I'm super glad they decided to swap out the old swill-filled carafe for the new offering. I sat there in the waiting room for the 20 minutes the oil change took, happily reading and sipping my coffee.<br /><br />(In case you're wondering, more than one person in the waiting room gave me a strange look for taking a picture of the coffee machine with my phone.)

        Want a quick route to inspiration and creativity? There probably isn't one, but one of the first steps is to swallow your pride. While brainstorming about ideas my girlfriend could use to create a new and eye-catching work of art, I suggested that we take the idea of Hieronymus Bosch's famous work "Garden of Earthly Delights" and implement the idea with a twist: use stuffed animals. Pose dozens and dozens of stuffed animals with one another, doing lewd and lascivious things with each other. Take a picture of the scene and that's your piece. (The name? "Garden of Furry Delights")<br /><br />Is that a really terrible idea? Of course it is. I knew that long before I ever mentioned it aloud.<br /><br />I don't apologize for bad ideas because I cannot count the number of times that I've spouted a bad idea and then someone else chimes up with another idea, in response to mine, that isn't half bad. The rest of the group takes the idea, runs with it, and end up with a final solution that's far better than my suggestion. I'm sure the people who are writing television shows experience this all the time.<br /><br />The key is in being able to wear humiliation like a badge (sometimes), and in surrounding yourself with people who won't just write off your less-than-good ideas as nonsense. This process doesn't even have to occur in a group. I consider every idea I have, and while a lot of them are bad, I end up refining several of them into resuable ideas.<br /><br />You need a lot of rough to sort through in order to find the diamonds.

        I maintained a blog for a very short period of time during college. (It was read by maybe one other person.)

        Perhaps the best question to ask first and foremost is whether or not, if Jesus were around in this day and age, with access to our technology, would he use it?<br /><br />I don't think it's a sacrilegious question to pose. (Although, if anyone thinks it is, I apologize for that). In his day, Jesus had twelve disciples that followed him around. He traveled around spreading his own message of hope, and the speed at which that message could travel was limited by how fast a person could travel. Which, at the time, was very, very slow. <br /><br />Think about how many people could follow him on Twitter now. Think about how much faster he could have spread his message to people given the tools afforded us by social media. Given the opportunity, I'm almost certain he would embrace the tools as they exist to give people hope.<br /><br />If you do a people search on Twitter for "Jesus", quite a few result come up for people who are tweeting using the name in some capacity. (My guess is that none of them are the real Jesus...just a hunch.)

        The smarter marketers like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2002/03/opt_in_matters_.html">Seth Godin</a> go against conventional wisdom, and practice their craft in accordance with the following fact:<br /><br />Opt Out = Spam<br /><br />If you automatically start sending people alerts and emails when they come to your site, with a small message at the bottom of each saying "You're getting these emails because you registered on our site. Feel free to go to your 'Settings' page to turn them off."<br /><br />You know what this sounds like? "Ha! We tricked you!" It's like those check boxes on registration forms that use convoluted language so that you don't know whether or not you should check the box to avoid getting emails from them.<br /><br />If I want to hear from you, I will tell you. Simple as that. Opt-in should be the standard for businesses and marketers that don't want to annoy their customers and burn their brand.<br /><br />A very similar thing happens on Facebook. As soon as you accept a friend request from someone, you're accepting not only the connection, but their wall posts become part of their news feed. Depending on how often they post updates, you might start hearing from them several times a day, whether you want to or not.<br /><br />Personally, this doesn't bother me. You're able to hide (opt out) of anyone's status updates that you want, but I choose not to block a single person because I want to hear what people have to say. Some people never post anything of interest to me, but that doesn't bother me. I want to hear what they have to say. If you're friends with me, I'm listening to what you say. I'm interested in diversity of opinion.<br /><br />If someone turns down a friend request from me, or removes me as a friend, I don't take it personally. You can only handle so many status updates in your news feed before it's overwhelming. (Some of my friends have almost 1000 friends of their own. I wonder how they handle the onslaught.)<br /><br />There's on exception to the "no block" guideline of mine: apps. I'm not interested in FarmVille, PersonalZoo, or any other games you're playing on there. I block them every time. Fortunately, you can block updates from apps without blocking statuses from that person. <br /><br />But it's interesting that Facebook assumes we want to get statuses from everyone we're friends with in our news feed, every group that each person has joined, every new connection made by friends. I know that these are editable under "Settings", but it's interesting that the default is "show me everything". <br /><br />Think of the way Twitter does this. Follow whoever you want by opting in.
