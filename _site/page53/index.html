                      It's very difficult to get someone's attention or generate interest with a single tweet or blog post. I have almost 200 posts on here now, and each one is a potential landing page. That means each post is a potential first impression for anyone who is stumbling blindly around the Internet looking for something, and happens to click a link that leads to one of my posts.Most of them probably won't stick around for long,...

                      Jed Simon, a guitar player in one of my favorite bands, was talking about how he writes songs as they come to him and then, after the fact, he shoehorns them into all kinds of different projects that he's working on.That's a great idea. It's similar in concept to picking an outlet. Once you've determined how you're going to unleash yourself onto the world, create logical groupings within that outlet. Cluster what you create, and...

                      The guy who started eBay began the whole idea by selling a broken laser pointer, which, to his astonishment, someone actually bought from him. Surprised, he contacted the buyer directly and asked him, "You realize that the laser pointer is broken, right?""Sure," the buyer replied. "I collect broken laser pointers."In hindsight, this strikes a person with the "Who Woulda Thunk?" syndrome. As it turns out, that can be a pretty good competitive advantage. I suspect...

                      A DVD isn't just a movie. It's a chance to upsell and cross-sell you.I was going to elaborate in a post on this point, but I came across this picture someone made that sums up the problem quite nicely:

                      I have complained in a few prior posts about the quality of coffee that auto maintenance places offer to the people sitting around in their cramped and uncomfortable waiting rooms. It seems like spending a few extra bucks for a decent coffee machine and decent coffee is pretty low-hanging fruit, as far as things you can do to keep customers happy while you're working on their car.I went to a local Jiffy Lube recently to...

                      Want a quick route to inspiration and creativity? There probably isn't one, but one of the first steps is to swallow your pride. While brainstorming about ideas my girlfriend could use to create a new and eye-catching work of art, I suggested that we take the idea of Hieronymus Bosch's famous work "Garden of Earthly Delights" and implement the idea with a twist: use stuffed animals. Pose dozens and dozens of stuffed animals with one...

                      I maintained a blog for a very short period of time during college. (It was read by maybe one other person.) Among the things I posted on it was a web comic that I called "Naked Dude". I don't remember what possessed me to write this (probably some terrible brand of lecture hall-tedium), but here are all of the three strips of "Naked Dude":
