                      Several times in my life, I've set out to make something happen that would be memorable. And I find that the harder I try, the less memorable it ends up being. Something that sticks in my mind tends to be unexpected, and the more effort you put into planning anything, the less likely you are to be surprised by anything that happens.I'll tell you what never works: trying to reproduce a past holiday or event...

                      I met a guy in college who swore by the Playboy method of pouring a glass of beer. You can view the instructions here. (Note: NSFW) These instructions has turned the simple act of pouring a beer into a scientific process with specific rules. The beer should be served at 43-46 &deg;F, the bottle (but not the glass) should be tilted at a 40&deg; downward angle, and there should be three pours, no more or...

                      There are two ways to appear smart in the eyes of others:1. Actually know what you're talking about.2. Make the people around you look dumb.I work as computer programmer, I attended middle school and high school, and I'm part of the human race, so I've met my fair share of people who think that #2 is a good shortcut to getting respect. You might win a few people over in the short-term, but eventually, those...

                      The movie The Boondock Saints opens with a priest giving a sermon, in which he preaches about the evils perpetrated by criminals in society. In talking about their morally deleterious effects on society, he adds:"There is another kind of evil which we must all fear most, and that is the indifference of good men."I've had lots of conversations with close personal friends of mine in which they're complaining about their jobs. They range from public...

                      Here are some (intended) characteristics of a book:1. Has a single point of entry.2. Progresses linearly from start to finish.3. Information is organized into a hierarchy.Most books, you're meant to read from the beginning to the end, and the information is structured into a natural hierarchy; books have chapters, chapters have sections, and so on. Inherently, there aren't any good reasons for these characteristics. They exist merely because of the constraints of printing information in...

                      TED is a large conference where lots of the best, brightest, or at least the most notorious, minds in the world gather in order to present interesting ideas to a large audience. It costs a lot of money to attend and more to be a speaker. For the rest of us, there's a massive online video archive that we all can watch for free.Most of my close friends already know about TED, but to my...

                      I went to the doctor's office a few weeks ago, and the one of the doctor's assistants led me into a large room lined with chairs all facing out a large picture window. The window was facing the parking lot, but beyond that there was a great view of the mountains. In the city where I live, you're never more than five miles from the adjacent mountain range bordering the north side of the city,...
