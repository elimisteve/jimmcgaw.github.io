        Several times in my life, I've set out to make something happen that would be memorable. And I find that the harder I try, the less memorable it ends up being. Something that sticks in my mind tends to be unexpected, and the more effort you put into planning anything, the less likely you are to be surprised by anything that happens.<br /><br />I'll tell you what <em>never</em> works: trying to reproduce a past holiday or event that was memorable. The harder you try to attach nostalgia, the more likely it is to slip away from you.<br /><br />What ends up sticking out is based on serendipity more than intent. And yet we take cameras everywhere we go, and spend months planning our weddings. Nothing wrong with that, but I find it difficult to believe that all this effort results in the desired effect: a more memorable occasion.

        I met a guy in college who swore by the Playboy method of pouring a glass of beer. You can view the instructions <a href="http://www.playboy.com/articles/how-to-pour-beer/index.html">here</a>. (Note: NSFW) These instructions has turned the simple act of pouring a beer into a scientific process with specific rules. The beer should be served at 43-46 &deg;F, the bottle (but <em>not</em> the glass) should be tilted at a 40&deg; downward angle, and there should be three pours, no more or less.<br /><br />So beer tastes better when you use a certain pour count and make sure you don't tip the glass at all? Apparently...according to some people. I'd be willing to stake money on the fact that, given a double-blind taste test, these same people would have a difficult time telling the difference.<br /><br />There's a certain world view held by lots of people that would have you believe that human beings are little fact-processing machines. They go further to claim that when a person believes something counter to evidence, it's attributable to a lack of intelligence. This fact machine is out of order...he's dumb!<br /><br />I don't think it's right to manipulate people through the use of misinformation, but the gentle art of persuasion has little to do with spewing facts at someone until they submit to your point of view. The beer story doesn't work because it uses facts that are scientifically proven; they work because they play to the vision most men have of themselves as debonair sophistos.<br /><br />So if you need to make an impact and change the way people think: cater to the superego instead of listing statistics.

        There are two ways to appear smart in the eyes of others:<br /><br />1. Actually know what you're talking about.<br /><br />2. Make the people around you look dumb.<br /><br />I work as computer programmer, I attended middle school and high school, and I'm part of the human race, so I've met my fair share of people who think that #2 is a good shortcut to getting respect. You might win a few people over in the short-term, but eventually, those people will wise up and move on. And those who won't figure it out are not the types of people you should aim to surround yourself with anyway.

        The movie <em>The Boondock Saints</em> opens with a priest giving a sermon, in which he preaches about the evils perpetrated by criminals in society. In talking about their morally deleterious effects on society, he adds:<br /><br />"There is another kind of evil which we must all fear most, and that is the indifference of good men."<br /><br />I've had lots of conversations with close personal friends of mine in which they're complaining about their jobs. They range from public servants to the business world. Usually, my friend is questioning the decisions being made by those in command above them. Because I want to be helpful, I usually try to suggest some course of action they can take in order to start changing things. Almost invariably, the suggestions are rejected. <br /><br />When I ask why they're unwilling to stand up and stir the pot, they all cite the same reason. The exact language varies, but in essence, they're saying the same thing. The five words that are the bane of the existence of every person who has a day job they hate: <br /><br /><em>"I get paid either way."</em><br /><br />This is the hell of it: if you go up the chain of command in any organization or municipality, the person signing the paychecks has an incentive to keep things they way they are. When things are good, they don't want things to be changed, so a system forms, and stability becomes the ultimate aim of that system. Most people and most companies aren't going to give you any good reason or encouragement to change things. We wait, patiently, for some external validation to go changes things, or instructions on how to do it, but almost nobody who initiates change ever actually has either of these.<br /><br />The problem with the priest's assertion is that "good" is a morally subjective term (the "saints" in the movie started killing criminals), and it's not useful because most people think of themselves as "good". But indifference can certainly be detrimental to the individual. It's a double-edged sword: it can be the product of satisfaction, but it can also indicate resignation and hopelessness.<br /><br />It's a question that each of us can only answer for ourselves, but worth asking: <em>What are you going to do in the face of a system that incentivizes good men to remain indifferent?</em><br /><br />You might get paid either way, but money isn't everything.

        Here are some (intended) characteristics of a book:<br /><br />1. Has a single point of entry.<br /><br />2. Progresses linearly from start to finish.<br /><br />3. Information is organized into a hierarchy.<br /><br />Most books, you're meant to read from the beginning to the end, and the information is structured into a natural hierarchy; books have chapters, chapters have sections, and so on. Inherently, there aren't any good reasons for these characteristics. They exist merely because of the constraints of printing information in the physical world, and because human beings insist on categorizing and organizing everything.<br /><br />In a digital world, this isn't true. In a single person's blog, for example, every post is a potential point of entry. The author can never assume that a person has read everything that came before or will read anything that came after. This makes it difficult to construct a larger point, and it gives the readers in the audience a license to be fickle.<br /><br />A single book is one thing, but it gets more complicated when you start dealing with large numbers of books. This is why bookstores and libraries play the genre game and use alphabetical order. Dewey thought he was being clever when he devised his decimal system, but there's no inherently good reason for that either. They're merely different methods of organizing chaos in the world before the Internet and Amazon.com came along.

        TED is a large conference where lots of the best, brightest, or at least the most notorious, minds in the world gather in order to present interesting ideas to a large audience. It costs a lot of money to attend and more to be a speaker. For the rest of us, there's a massive online video archive that we all can watch for free.<br /><br />Most of my close friends already know about TED, but to my "weak ties" out there: I'd encourage you to dip into their online archive and listen to a few. At their worst, they can be pedantic, but at their best, they're extremely inspirational and make you see the world a different way. All of them are guaranteed to teach you something.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorites; you mileage may vary:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html">The Child-Driven Education</a> - Ten years ago, a researcher puts a computer with the Internet in a wall in a city in India otherwise devoid of technology. The kids figure out how to use the computer (without any instructions) and teach themselves more than I've probably forgotten from first grade.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html">When Ideas Have Sex</a> - <em>Genome</em> author Matt Ridley talks about how members of society combine their ideas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html">J.J. Abrams and the Mystery Box</a> - "Sometimes mystery is more important than knowledge." It's a few years old, but still worth a watch. Based on what he says, <em>nobody</em> should have been surprised that "Lost" ended with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Go, now, fan them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TED">Facebook</a>...it's a worthwhile addition to your News Feed.

        I went to the doctor's office a few weeks ago, and the one of the doctor's assistants led me into a large room lined with chairs all facing out a large picture window. The window was facing the parking lot, but beyond that there was a great view of the mountains. In the city where I live, you're never more than five miles from the adjacent mountain range bordering the north side of the city, so there are lots of vantage points where you can look out and see them.<br /><br />But I'm originally from the Detroit area, which is topographically as a flat as a pancake, and where I sit at work, I don't have a view of the mountains. So I said to the assistant, "Wow, you guys sure do have a great view from here."<br /><br />She followed my eyes out the window and snorted. "Yeah, a great view," she said sarcastically, "of the parking lot." I can tell from the way she said it that she completely missed what I was really talking about. She had no idea I was being sincere, and that I was talking about the mountains.<br /><br />We all get used to things. We spend every day immersed in our routines, where we become oblivious to the mountains and dwell on the parking lot that's right in front of us. We adapt, and part of that is losing perspective on the stuff we see all the time. That's human nature.<br /><br />But I hope, for your sake, that when someone comes to your office, and points out how nice the mountains look, that at that point you'll at least be able to see them and not just the parking lot.

        David Byrne of The Talking Heads said recently that most people have all the music the could ever want or need. I have to agree with him; music is everywhere, and the sheer abundance of new music that's being produced by independent artists and being uploaded to MySpace every day is overwhelming. There's certainly well over 24 hours worth of new music being produced every day, which means that no person is going to be able to listen to all of it.<br /><br />Music to be special just because of the economics of recording and distributing albums. But music is no longer scarce. I'm old enough that I remember wanting to write and record music as a teenager, but not being able to afford the equipment that would have enabled me to get decent results, and distribution was still a challenge. (My teen years pre-date Napster.) Now, of course, that's all been upended. I managed to buy decent recording gear for a few hundred dollars and I can produce as much music as I'd like right in my living room.<br /><br />And, just as easily, so can everyone else. That means it's becoming harder and harder to write a song that really captures peoples' imaginations. Creating high-quality music isn't a huge obstacle. And there's so many people experimenting with different styles and sounds of music that it's becoming more and more difficult to write a song that sounds truly original on its own. Lots of people are trying, and that just increases the amount of clutter that's out there.<br /><br />I posit that much of the music that enjoys massive commercial success (e.g. Lady Gaga) isn't musically or technically superior to a lot of the amateur content on the Internet. Sure, there's a lot of garbage on MySpace...but there's also songs by independent artists that are really well-written, technically proficient, and sound professionally produced. So why does Lady Gaga get all the fame while so many hard-working amateurs struggle?<br /><br />What Lady Gaga, U2, and all bands that sell out large stadiums for performances are offering to fans is <em>belonging</em>. Part of the appeal of Lady Gaga (or any other mainstream act with a massive following) is that fans instantly, by virtue of listening to her music, get to become a part of a large group of people. Even if their music isn't discernibly better than that of amateurs, people want what everyone else wants. They want to buy something to fit in with their peers.<br /><br />So how do you write a song that does <em>that</em>? Or a better question: once you've written it, how do you market it that way?

        Any ideal or action you hope to spread is dependent (at least partially) on the ability of people to call it by its name. Drunk driving was a massive problem back in the 1980s, and several campaigns were put in place to try and teach people about the dangers of drinking and driving. Facts and statistics were used to some avail.<br /><br />Then they decided to call one person in the group the "designated driver". Simple concept: one person in the group stays sober and gets everyone else home without crashing into a tree. This wasn't a new idea, but the name solified the concept amongst groups of drinkers. The sober person in the group suddenly had something to call themselves when the bartender asked them if they wanted a drink. The DDs could find one another in bars, where they could exchange sob stories about having drawn the shortest straw for that particular evening.<br /><br />The name, not the idea, changed drinking culture and behavior of the people in it.
