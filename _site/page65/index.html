                      When you need to make a copy, fax something, or print up a bunch of pages for yourself, you have two options. You can try and go over to the copy machine at work when everyone else is at lunch and, with the stealth of a ninja, and try to take care of your business without anyone catching you.Or, more likely, you'll just go to Kinko's, because that's where everyone goes to do office stuff....

                      So what if you're dealing with someone that won't let you just do your job the way you see fit? What if you have a boss that's constantly butting in to check up on how you're doing, and giving you pointers about how you should be doing your tasks?Here's how you take the offensive: ask a ton of clarifying questions about every little detail. And I mean a ton. Dozens and dozens each day. Don't...

                      When I was a teenager, I used to listen to a lot of Bob Dylan. Not because he can sing well, but for everything else. I'd like to open my book of Dylan and recite a page from "The Times They Are A-Changin'":"Come mothers and fathers throughout the land,And don't criticize what you can't understand."As my generation slowly leaves the realm of young adulthood and enters the age of being parents, I'm surprised at how...

                      Recently, I posted a status update on Facebook, as follows:"My employer offered me the afternoon off. Four hours for which I'm getting paid but doing nothing. Taking my wages for that time to the grocery store, buying that much food, and dropping it off at the local food bank. Namaste."Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of "back-patting" going on in the above statement. I was out for the maximum number of "Like" clicks that...

                      There is a conventional wisdom about how you should go about learning a new language. Let's say that you decide you've got a thing for German girls (or guys, as the reader's orientation may vary), and so you decide to learn German and spend a year in Germany drinking beer and getting freaky with the (hopefully) attractive locals.To learn German, here are the four things you should practice, in this order, to ease yourself into...

                      There's a line from an old Stephen King made-for-TV movie called Storm of the Century that was mentioned by the villain in the story very early on: "Hell is repetition."There's also an old sales trick, mentioned in the classic book on persuasion, Influence by Robert B. Cialdini, that you can get people to commit to something by getting them to answer "yes" to a series of small questions that build on one another."Do you love...

                      If you're going to start and run your own coffee shop, here's the very first thing you should do before you even start deciding what kind of coffee you're going to serve to your customers: go to the place you're planning to lease and count the outlets. Where are they positioned? Make sure there are at least two plugs per table, and that they're accessible to each table without having to run a lot of...

                      I know a few people who claim that they don't watch any television. None. They refuse to do this because they feel the majority of television is insulting to their intelligence, uninteresting, and is responsible for making people stupider. I don't really agree with their elitist take on how television is making those who watch it "stupider", but I do understand why they feel it has little to offer them. Personally, I watch just enough...

                      There's a sight called Squidoo that was founded by marketing guru Seth Godin. After you sign up, you get to create a page that is your own "lens", with content from all corners of the internet that interests you. People can find your lens, you can view the lens' of others, and there is a "most popular lenses" type feature on the home page. I haven't found the site very useful, but there are lots...

                      You've met that person. The person who comes off as arrogant, name-dropping, and condescending. It's clear that they think they're better than you in several ways, and while we all feel this way to some extent, this person has an unabashed knack of implying it in casual conversation. And they do it often.The most annoying thing I've found is that you cannot compete with a person who has the elitist mentality, because they'll always find...
