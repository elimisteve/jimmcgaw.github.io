        When you need to make a copy, fax something, or print up a bunch of pages for yourself, you have two options. You can try and go over to the copy machine at work when everyone else is at lunch and, with the stealth of a ninja, and try to take care of your business without anyone catching you.<br/><br/>Or, more likely, you'll just go to Kinko's, because that's where everyone goes to do office stuff. Right?<br/><br/>I became interested in Kinko's about a year ago when I moved to Santa Barbara. The first Kinko's was opened by Paul Orfalea in Isla Vista, the small beach community where most of the UCSB students live. (And have a massive party every Halloween that attracts every police officer in Southern California.) Mr. Orfalea opened it because there was simply no easy way for students to make copies for themselves other than the library.<br/><br/>Here's the interesting part: what made Kinko's get really big and popular, as a company, is no longer true today. When Mr. Orfalea first started the company, the culture he created was one of individuals doing their own jobs the best way they saw fit. Since it was acquired by FedEx, the strategy has changed drastically to a more command and control system, with orders trickling from on high down the rank and file employees.<br/><br/>Have you been there recently? It's a nightmare. The people who work there are just like those actors in the Dave Chapelle Kinko's skit, where the comedian was parodying the franchise by making the employees seem like they didn't care at all about customer service. This skit resonated with me, because I can't remember a single favorable experience I've had there. Whenever I can, I do what Mr. Orfalea was originally working to help people avoid: I'll go to the library instead of Kinko's.<br/><br/>The fact that they are still charging by the minute for Internet usage if you want to print something is living, livid proof that the company has ceased to care about its customers' needs and are now just focusing on the bottom line. <em>Internet is not expensive anymore. Why are you charging me for it?</em><br/><br/>Whenever I consistently have a terrible experience at a company, time and again, all I smell is opportunity. I'm not going to open a copy store to compete with the local Kinko's, because I don't have much passion for that particular line of work. My guess is that most people are terrified of the prospect of doing this because, hey, <em>everyone</em> just goes to Kinko's, right?<br/><br/>I don't. And if a store opened up that offered a better experience, I would gladly frequent it. <br/><br/>Here is one big thing that makes the Kinko's experience miserable: usability of the machines. Even the employees seem to be struggling with how to get those over-sized industrial copy machines to print what they want. They also seem to be breaking down a lot. Here's how you take on Kinko's: get really great machines that are intuitive and easy to use, with great support from the manufacturer, and stock your first store with those. They might cost a little more to start with, but if you do things right, you'll have a much easier time scaling the business without sacrificing as much quality.<br/><br/>Please, somebody do this. I have copies to make.

        So what if you're dealing with someone that won't let you just do your job the way you see fit? What if you have a boss that's constantly butting in to check up on how you're doing, and giving you pointers about how you should be doing your tasks?<br/><br/>Here's how you take the offensive: ask a ton of clarifying questions about every little detail. And I mean a ton. Dozens and dozens each day. Don't wait for them to come over and bother you. Go bother them, in their office, with lots of serious and thoughtful questions.<br/><br/>Remember the carpenter on <em>Seinfeld</em> who was hired to re-design Jerry's kitchen? He drove Jerry insane asking about every little detail. If you're being micro-managed, your homework assignment is to watch that episode (along with several others to de-stress yourself) and then go into work tomorrow ready to act like that guy. Well-meaning but annoying.<br/><br/>If nothing else, take consolation in the fact that the micro-manager is mostly responsible if you screw something up.

        When I was a teenager, I used to listen to a lot of Bob Dylan. Not because he can sing well, but for everything else. I'd like to open my book of Dylan and recite a page from "The Times They Are A-Changin'":<br/><br/>"Come mothers and fathers throughout the land,<br/>And don't criticize what you can't understand."<br/><br/>As my generation slowly leaves the realm of young adulthood and enters the age of being parents, I'm surprised at how many of my peers are failing to adapt to new things. Several of my friends have denounced Twitter as being "stupid" and "pointless" simply because they don't understand the value in it. (Most of these people were saying the same thing about Facebook and MySpace when they launched five years ago; now most of those people use them.)<br/><br/>You know what's funny? I'm in my twenties and I know lots of people my own age who are already "grumpy old men". Give them 40 or 50 years and they'll turn into the curmudgeons sitting in diners eating soup and whining about "these young people today". Chances are good these grumpy old people didn't acquire their distaste for youth over time. More likely, they were sitting around complaining about people even when they were young, in the prime of their lives.<br/><br/>Youth is wasted on the young. [sigh]

        Recently, I posted a status update on Facebook, as follows:<br/><br/>"My employer offered me the afternoon off. Four hours for which I'm getting paid but doing nothing. Taking my wages for that time to the grocery store, buying that much food, and dropping it off at the local food bank. Namaste."<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of "back-patting" going on in the above statement. I was out for the maximum number of "Like" clicks that I could get from people who felt that I what I was doing what a good thing, and I got several. If you were one of them, thanks.<br/><br/>But you're not the only group of people amongst my friends that I was trying to get to notice. I was going after another group of people on my friend list, and I'll explain who they are and why I was targeting them.<br/><br/>There are a few of my friends that are, for lack of a better term, social Darwinists. They think that people that cannot afford to feed themselves are in that predicament because they lack initiative. They attribute it to the character of those people, instead of their circumstances. Which is not incorrect in and of itself, but it's a different worldview from my own, and I don't fully understand it.<br/><br/>Here's where it gets interesting: I don't think that this "survival of the fittest" mentality is necessarily based on a lack of compassion. Hear me out: I believe that people who refuse to give to the needy refuse to do so <em>because</em> they are being somewhat empathetic (or so they think.) They believe those without food are suffering in many ways, and if you give them any food, you are being an enabler. You are prolonging their suffering. It's more humane to let them perish, and end their suffering in a "natural", perhaps Malthusian fashion.<br/><br/>Again, this is not how I feel; I disagree with this point of view entirely. That's why I donated to the food bank.<br/><br/>We're pretty good at rationalizing a "bad" or "immoral" action that we've done. It's a neat little trick that our brains play on us so that we can bear to look ourselves in the mirror each morning. In psychology it's called "cognitive dissonance". You feel bad about, or regret, some action that you took in the past. Since you can't change the past, you change how you feel or think about the action in your head so that it was no longer "wrong", in your perception.<br/><br/>So here's the question: since we have this powerful mechanism in our brains that allows us to turn a perceived bad into something we can live with, why can't it go the other way?<br/><br/>Specific to the action I took above: I was given the money in the form of a paycheck, but I didn't do anything to earn it. I could rationalize keeping it because I'm entitled to free money because I'm awesome (?),<br/><br/>-OR-<br/><br/>Rationalize giving it away because I didn't actually take the steps needed to earn it.<br/><br/>If you can't convince other people that you're "right", perhaps you can convince them that you're less than wrong. Subtlety counts.

        There is a conventional wisdom about how you should go about learning a new language. Let's say that you decide you've got a thing for German girls (or guys, as the reader's orientation may vary), and so you decide to learn German and spend a year in Germany drinking beer and getting freaky with the (hopefully) attractive locals.<br/><br/>To learn German, here are the four things you should practice, in this order, to ease yourself into the language:<br/><br/>1. Read German.<br/>2. Listen to German being spoken.<br/>3. Speak German.<br/>4. Write German.<br/><br/>The reason these steps exist, and are in this order, makes sense. Reading is done first because you can do it at your own pace, and gives you a visual sense of the language before you hear or speak it. Then, practice listening to it spoken aloud, and catch as much as you can. Once you've been able to comprehend what others say and write, work on getting other people to comprehend what <em>you</em> say and write. Writing comes last because it requires a really good command of grammer, idioms,<br/><br/>There's a fifth step here, which I'm going to tack on: Write a German children's book. The reason for this is that you can write anything you like in German, but it's going to be tough to get German mothers to read it to their children if it clashes with their culture. Mothers are very careful about the morals and values they expose their children to, and if you haven't mastered German language, you won't be able to convince German mothers they should read your book to their child.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm blurring the lines between mastering a language and mastering a new culture. In some ways, I don't really think there's a distinction there. Besides, unless you're really attractive, you'll need to understand the German culture if you want to effectively lure people into bed with you.

        There's a line from an old Stephen King made-for-TV movie called <em>Storm of the Century</em> that was mentioned by the villain in the story very early on: "Hell is repetition."<br/><br/>There's also an old sales trick, mentioned in the classic book on persuasion, <em>Influence</em> by Robert B. Cialdini, that you can get people to commit to something by getting them to answer "yes" to a series of small questions that build on one another.<br/><br/>"Do you love your family and want them to be safe?"<br/><br/>"Wouldn't you rather be driving a car that has a proven safety record for your children's protection?"<br/><br/>"Will you buy a car from me so I can earn a sales commission on it?"<br/><br/>If you answered "yes" to the first two, it makes little sense to answer "no" to the last question, and out comes your wallet. Of course, a lot of us are now aware of this tactic, so when we are approached on the street by anyone with a clipboard asking us the first question, regardless of what it is or what our answer would be, we try and skirt the question and walk around them.<br/><br/>The road to Hell is paved with little yeses. Yes, our intentions are good, and that's where the first two "yeses" invariably come from. But, to slightly mangle the words of the annoying salesguy in <em>Groundhog Day</em>: "Watch out for that last step, it's a doosey!"

        If you're going to start and run your own coffee shop, here's the very first thing you should do before you even start deciding what kind of coffee you're going to serve to your customers: go to the place you're planning to lease and count the outlets. Where are they positioned? Make sure there are at least two plugs per table, and that they're accessible to each table without having to run a lot of cables all over the place. <br/><br/>This is a pain point with a lot of frequenters of coffee shops, particular at peak times when your seating is at capacity and everyone is pounding away on their laptops. It doesn't matter than we're only a few years away from laptops with solid-state drives with long battery lives that don't need to always be plugged in. Take the time, spend the extra money, and make sure customers have easy access to the juice when they need it.<br/><br/>If you're already an established coffee shop, consider closing for the renovation instead of running extension cords all over the place. I'm dead serious. And while we're on the subject, offer free wireless. Password protect it if you must, but none of this "Choose how many hours you want to use it and put in your credit card." If I wanted to pay for wireless Internet access I'd go to Starbucks.

        I know a few people who claim that they don't watch any television. None. They refuse to do this because they feel the majority of television is insulting to their intelligence, uninteresting, and is responsible for making people stupider. I don't really agree with their elitist take on how television is making those who watch it "stupider", but I do understand why they feel it has little to offer them. <br/><br/>Personally, I watch just enough television to stay relevant. I enjoy watching TV shows on DVD, which is a relatively new phenomenon. This whole trend started with Lost, which takes the so-called "story arc" format of a continuous running storyline between episodes. While Lost was certainly not the first show to have this format, it was the first big hit in the age of DVD that people of moderate intelligence latched onto.<br/><br/>Most of my friends have latched onto at least one story arc television show. The interesting thing about how this works is that you get sucked into the ongoing plot by renting the first season on DVD. You manage to get through the first season in a marathon sessions of three or four evenings, and, if it's well written, there's a doosey of a cliffhanger at the end of season one that makes you jump right into season two. (Lost did this beautifully by deftly introducing new conflict in its season one ending; the copycat Heroes did a terrible job because it only provided resolution.) And so, once hooked, you start following the show on broadcast television, at the near-comatose rate of one episode per week, the plotline polluted with commercials.<br/><br/>Lost could never have been as successful in an age without something like DVDs and a major distribution chain like Netflix. Releasing it back in the 1980s would have generated a small cult following, but there's no way it would have become the viral hit that it ended up becoming. Because it's available to almost anyone on DVD, anyone can take a friend's recommendation, rent it, and catch up, following the show right from the beginning. (If you try jumping in in the middle someplace, you're never going to figure it out.) And because Netflix isn't as constrained as your local Blockbuster was in stocking its VHS titles back in the 1990's, lots more people get a chance to get in on the story.<br/><br/>I don't watch stuff like The Biggest Loser, but it's funny to me to wonder if people ever discuss these shows the way people discuss Lost. Do people sit around the water cooler talking about the episode where The Biggest Loser stopped being interesting? Are there debates about when The Bachelor started to go downhill? Is it a point of heated contention in forums across the Internet exactly when American Idol stopped being meaningful and just became preachy and boring?<br/><br/>Naturally, they don't, because they never set the bar that high. And while the nerds that watch Lost aren't the most judgmental group of people by any measure, they do have a knack for taking their own expectations way too seriously.

        There's a sight called Squidoo that was founded by marketing guru Seth Godin. After you sign up, you get to create a page that is your own "lens", with content from all corners of the internet that interests you. People can find your lens, you can view the lens' of others, and there is a "most popular lenses" type feature on the home page. I haven't found the site very useful, but there are lots of people sharing recipes and petlovers sharing stories about their cats on there.<br/><br/>The one thing that I do find interesting is the use of the term "lens" to describe your little page. It intrigues me because I've always thought of people as lenses in and of themselves. It defines who we are as people. When you meet a new person for the first time, or are hanging out with a friend, they are really offering you a window into their own perception of reality, through their opinions. The point their lens at something, choose the filter that best suits them, and then let you gaze into it.<br/><br/>Our own brains are pretty good at this, too. The little voice chattering incessantly between your own ears has its own way of filtering out information, picking and choosing what it accepts into consideration. It influences our own reflections of the world around us. Someone could probably write a pretty terrible poem stretching this "perception as light" simile way too far.

        You've met that person. The person who comes off as arrogant, name-dropping, and condescending. It's clear that they think they're better than you in several ways, and while we all feel this way to some extent, this person has an unabashed knack of implying it in casual conversation. And they do it often.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing I've found is that you cannot compete with a person who has the elitist mentality, because they'll always find a way to put themselves above you. Maybe they're a lawyer, and you could go to law school yourself, thereby making yourself their social equal, but they'll find some problem with the quality of your work. You went to Wayne State University Law School, but they went to Columbia Law School, so they have a "better" education and therefore they're a better lawyer. You studied corporate law, but they studied patent law, which is, like, dude, <em>so</em> much harder than corporate law. Maybe they've been published in The National Law Journal, so you write and get yourself published in The New York Law Journal, but then they harbor the opinion that The New York Law Journal is a much lower quality publication and they take any piece of writing they can get their hands on.<br/><br/>You can't win with these kinds of people. In college, I knew quite a few people with this elitist mentality, and they annoyed me, particularly when they went on and on about how much smarter they were than everyone else. The highlight of dealing with them? I used to argue with one of them that they were not, in fact, any smarter than everyone else. I made the case that everyone has valuable knowledge, just different kinds of knowledge and that the perception of its worth tends to vary between people. For making this argument so often and with such fervor, this person called me arrogant.<br/><br/>It's irony on a base level; it still makes me laugh.<br/><br/>I think the best way to deal with these people is to play ignorant of their accomplishments, or feign blindness to their significance. One of my favorite gags on the American version of television show "The Office" is that one character is constantly mentioning that he graduated from Cornell. In one episode, one of his co-workers innocently asks him, "Where did you go to school again?"
