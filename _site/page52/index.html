                      That goes for all markets. The stock market, the labor market, the job market, and the market for anything else you can think of. That means it's never going to be as easy as you think.There's lot of books about how to find a job, how to invest in stocks and make money, how to get a book published, and so on. All of this advice might be very prudent, but you can never expect...

                      Every history teacher I ever had was working, whether they knew it or not, as a brand manager. They spent their days shaping the perceptions that we, as students, have of this country based on what they taught. The brand has been built, tweaked, and solidified in our minds over several years, and as a result, we feel a sense of pride when we put little American flags on our cars, wear T-shirts, and bumper...

                      I'm sure that lots of people have been wondering what exactly possessed me to start feeding my blog into Facebook each and every day. The short answer: ego. But a more refined question might be to ask what makes me think anyone would be interested in hearing my opinions, thoughts on marketing, and business ideas.

                      In Detroit, the Tigers used to play baseball in Tiger Stadium, but not anymore. Now they play it in Comerica Park.There was a change in location when the team moved to a new stadium in 2000, and with it came a name change. It's called Comerica park because Comerica bank agreed to pay $66 million over 30 years for the right to name the stadium. Just about every major sports stadium in the country now...

I have a couple of enterprising friends on Facebook who share the funnier subject lines about penis enlargement from their spam email folder on their statuses, and many people seem to have a good laugh, but aside from this, no one has found any merit in spam whatsoever.So why do we keep getting overwhelmed with spam emails?

                      When I was much younger, in elementary school, I used to entertain a fantasy that my life was a television show. This came from watching stuff like "The Wonder Years" or "Pete and Pete", where the show has a narrator that's explaining and analyzing the world around them. I used to sit on the swings on the playground and weave little bits of dialogue in my head that helped me make sense of the world...

                      Have you ever been asked this question: if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? If you asked me that in high school, I would have given you all kinds of answers, ranging from something about my physical appearance to wanting a little bit more disposable income to spend on weekends out with friends.A couple of years ago, I finally settled on an answer that hasn't changed: I would like people...

                      We're all aware of the more high-profile celebrities who are inspiring people to make a positive change in our lives. Suze Orman teaches women the importance of getting their financial lives in order. Seth Godin inspires entrepreneurs and marketers to think in new ways. Zig Ziglar hands out lessons in the world of selling.These people have much greater reach than the rest of us, and that's part of their appeal. We like to be part...

                      Verizon Wireless must love me.My cell phone carrier charges me $60 a month for 400 minutes worth of call time and text-messages. I use maybe 20 minutes a month, generally with people who also have Verizon. They're getting that $60 a month no matter how much cost I'm incurring for them based on my usage, and I know that they're banking a ton of profit from me.This is common. You might have seen those commercials...

                      I participate in the efforts of a local nonprofit organization, and the guy who's running everything holds weekly meetings to discuss fundraising and other challenges. He insists that everyone show up ready to brainstorm and come up with lots of ideas.
