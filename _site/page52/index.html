        Every history teacher I ever had was working, whether they knew it or not, as a brand manager. They spent their days shaping the perceptions that we, as students, have of this country based on what they taught. The brand has been built, tweaked, and solidified in our minds over several years, and as a result, we feel a sense of pride when we put little American flags on our cars, wear T-shirts, and bumper stickers.<br /><br />Our sense of nationalism has produced all forms of swag, and we wear and display them with pride.<br /><br />If you're an educator, you are a marketer, and if you're a marketer, you're an educator. Our perception of a product is based on how the brand has been advertised and marketed to us. The same is true for the country in which you live. I grew up having to recite "The Pledge of Allegiance" every single day in elementary school, the exact reason for which still hasn't been explained to me.<br /><br />I don't believe that a love for your country is a bad thing, and that's certainly not what I'm implying here. Nationalism is a good thing in a lot of ways. I'm only pointing out that there is a lot of overlap between teaching and marketing. It's about developing a relationship, making a connection, and then leveraging the goodwill of that relationship in order to influence. There's a lot of power and responsibility implicit in those roles.<br /><br />Marketers in the 21st century have found that it's extremely difficult to lie and get away with it. Traditional advertisers were able to control the message they broadcast about their product or service, and for the most part, recipients believed the message. That was how they managed to sell tobacco and crappy cars to us.<br /><br />But we've gotten too good at detecting dishonesty for this to work anymore, and we've also recognized that companies have no incentive to be honest with us about their products. So, we rely on word of mouth and the testimonials of our peers. The importance of the author blurb and editorial review on Amazon is way less important to me than the genuine reviews of other readers.<br /><br />I think educators might be facing the same challenge. Like most kids in America, I grew up learning about the United States from textbooks with a very one-sided perspective. They painted our country as being infallible, perfect, and iconic in the eyes of all other countries. But don't be surprised if, when those kids grow up, they learn that there's another side to the stories they were taught in history class. There's a chance that the blind patriotism you tried to teach those kids will backfire on you horribly. <br /><br />I think the United States is a great enough country that we don't need to filter its history in order for people to love it. We've been far from perfect, and we've made some horrible mistakes. (Our treatment of the Native Americans comes to mind.) But those mistakes alone are not enough to undermine the value of our democracy.

        I'm sure that lots of people have been wondering what exactly possessed me to start feeding my blog into Facebook each and every day. The short answer: ego. But a more refined question might be to ask what makes me think anyone would be interested in hearing my opinions, thoughts on marketing, and business ideas. It's not as though I've ever pioneered a new invention in the marketplace or started a (success) company as an entrepreneur. Who am I to be offering my advice and ideas to anyone?<br /><br />I'm nobody...but that's the point. If life and history have taught me anything about what it means to be successful, it's that one critical component is luck. <br /><br />However you choose to define success, good luck must play a key role for anyone in attaining it. In business, we all seem to attribute major successes to the character of the person who pushed through hard times and came out on top, and so we listen to what they have to say in the hopes that their words will contain some nugget of wisdom that will lead us down a similar path. But I think that most of them were, in large part, extremely lucky. (In other words: "Individual results may vary.")<br /><br />Even if you can attribute success to a person's character, Malcolm Gladwell makes a pretty good case in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/">Outliers</a></em> that often, a person's character is also determined by circumstances. Bill Gates worked very hard to be where he is today, but he was also very lucky, too.<br /><br />If I ever were to start a successful business and then sell it for millions of dollars, I'm sure that, for better or worse, lots more people would start looking to me for advice. And if I manage to rein in the ego I mentioned at the beginning of this post, instead of wallowing in all the props, here is the first piece of advice I'd give to everyone: don't let my dumb luck lead you to believe that you should listen to me. <br /><br />The successful are the fortuitous, so don't seek advice only from them. Don't let the past success of any teacher act as a filter that drives what lessons you choose to learn and those you ignore.

        In Detroit, the Tigers used to play baseball in Tiger Stadium, but not anymore. Now they play it in Comerica Park.<br /><br />There was a change in location when the team moved to a new stadium in 2000, and with it came a name change. It's called Comerica park because Comerica bank agreed to pay $66 million over 30 years for the right to name the stadium. Just about every major sports stadium in the country now is named after some company that paid an outrageous sum of money for the right to put their name on it. <br /><br />Companies love doing this sort of thing because, dollar for dollar, having the name "Comerica" on the name of the stadium where the Tigers are playing gets you tons of exposure. Every time a story about a game runs, your name is very likely to come up in print. A young child goes to his first baseball game in Comerica park, creating a positive branding association in his mind. Or when someone gets mugged in Detroit and the evening news mentions it happened "just outside Comerica Park". (That would be the downside of this whole branding escapade.)<br /><br />I'm not the first person to bemoan the fact that the new stadium got a new name that was determined by a company that paid lots of money for it. I'm not even going to say that it's wrong, but it is a little disappointing. The old Tiger Stadium was, in its earlier days, called "Navin Field" and "Briggs Field", after two of the Tigers owners. The field has to be named <em>something</em>, but it's too bad that instead paying homage to its past, it auctioned off the right to name the stadium to the highest bidder.<br /><br />The most ridiculous of these pay-to-name arrangements that I've ever heard is probably the <a href="http://www.jobingarena.com/index.php">Jobber.com Arena</a> in Glendale, AZ. <br /><br />What gets me is they didn't even set any standards about who the "highest bidder" could be. They could have restricted the candidates to only non-profit organizations that were working, at the time, to benefit the local communities in Detroit. It could have been the Red Cross Stadium. It's interesting to wonder if the Red Cross would even want to take part in that whole branding debacle, and if not, I'd be very interested in learning why.<br /><br />Or, consider the other side of it: if you're Comerica bank, you purchase the right to name the new Tiger stadium, and there's no rule that says you need to stick the name "Comerica" on it. What if they had opted, in the face of every other stadium being named after some company or brand, to simply call it "Tiger Stadium"? Sooner or later, people might ask why every other sports arena in the country is named after some organization out to brand itself, save for "Tiger Stadium" in Detroit. And the answer would be: "Comerica bought the rights to name the park, but they just decided to leave it as 'Tiger Stadium'." You wouldn't get your name on the news every time the sportscaster in Detroit starts talking about the Tigers, but you would start conversations among people by playing into their natural curiosity. They question the exception or the out of the ordinary, and when they get their answer, it resonates with them.<br /><br />Does this work? I'm not sure. Did it work for <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100107114534AAYm8tp">purple</a>?<br /><br />Maybe I'm just cranky, but I have a lot of faith in the potential to reach people by being the exception in a sea of annoyances.

        I've never met a single person that likes getting spam. Not one. Everybody hates it. I have a couple of enterprising friends on Facebook who share the funnier subject lines about penis enlargement from their spam email folder on their statuses, and many people seem to have a good laugh, but aside from this, no one has found any merit in spam whatsoever.<br /><br />So why do we keep getting overwhelmed with spam emails? I still wonder about this a lot, and bring it up in conversation. Most people I talk to simply dismiss the annoyance, under the assumption that spammers must be attaining enough success with their vexing email blasts in order to make it worth the cost. The cost of sending out mass spam emails is pretty small, so you only need a very small number of people to respond and buy something in order to make it worth your while. Maybe from a strict financial "rate of return" standpoint, this makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Forget about rate of return for a moment. Forget the financial stuff you learned when you were in business school. Marketing has to be cost effective, yes, but what you're not doing when you measure the ROI of a spam campaign is quantifying the effect of the "misses". You might blast 40,000 people with a spam email, and if only 3 of them convert and buy something from your site, then perhaps you've made a profit from this small handful of hits, but you've potentially pissed off/annoyed/infuriated the other 39,997 people who had to take the time and effort to recognize it was spam, and then delete it.<br /><br />And on top of that, spamming is a big marketing failure simply because I can't recite the name of a single company that's ever spammed me before. Unfortunately, spamming is not the "anti-branding", because it doesn't generate much negative word-of-mouth among people for the simple reason that people are so accustomed to ignoring it. We don't take notice of no-name sites that spam our email boxes. They can't destroy their brands because they never bothered to build a reputation with customers in the first place. <br /><br />Perhaps Bayesian filters are so good in email clients these days that spam emails are essentially a non-issue for most of us. I use Gmail, and I can't remember the last time a spam email showed up in my Inbox. (Instead of the Spam folder.)<br /><br />But I think the success of a marketing campaign can be measured by what happens with the "misses". If you're annoying the majority of people you're marketing to, just to get a one-time sale from a small portion of your audience, then you're not being effective, you're burning bridges.

        When I was much younger, in elementary school, I used to entertain a fantasy that my life was a television show. This came from watching stuff like "The Wonder Years" or "Pete and Pete", where the show has a narrator that's explaining and analyzing the world around them. I used to sit on the swings on the playground and weave little bits of dialogue in my head that helped me make sense of the world and people around me. <br /><br />For many years during my childhood, I wove this little inner monologue in my head as though it was the narrator in my own television show. I entertained the notion that the world around me was nothing more than an oversized and elaborate television studio, that those around me were actors, and that I was the star in some television show being broadcast to thousands. I felt the need to dramatize things and add descriptive detail to my thoughts to keep things interesting for my thousands of fans.<br /><br />Now, I wasn't delusional. If someone had asked me if I really thought that my entire world around me, from my home to my school, was an elaborately constructed television set full of hidden cameras to record what I was doing, or whether everyone around me were just actors playing along with whatever I said, I would have said, "Of course not." But I entertained the idea in my head, as a fantasy, and played out the fantasy in my spare time on the playground. I spent a lot of time narrating and analyzing what was happening in my life inside of my own head, as if I were the star of my own show. This was the making of a largely ego-centric personality on my part.<br /><br />This is why when I saw the movie <em>The Truman Show</em> when I was in high school, the movie resonated with me. The central character, Truman Burbank, is constantly on camera and, unbeknownst to him, his entire life is taking place on a large, constructed movie set and is being broadcast live on television 24 hours a day. The plot of the movie is the sequence of events that unfold as it slowly dawns on Truman that something seems wrong with the world around him.<br /><br />The feasibility of the movie's premise is the criticism that I hear most often about the film itself. But if you look past the plot holes, it's a pretty good movie, and I think, to a certain extent, it represents the way we see the world around us, with one important difference: we're willing and fully aware participants in the whole production. I think we all see ourselves as the star in our little worlds and among the people around us, and we're having fun participating in the whole thing. And we weave little narrations in our head to help make sense of it all.<br /><br />This is, I think, the secret of persuasion: figure out the story someone's telling themselves and then play along.

        Have you ever been asked this question: if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? If you asked me that in high school, I would have given you all kinds of answers, ranging from something about my physical appearance to wanting a little bit more disposable income to spend on weekends out with friends.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I finally settled on an answer that hasn't changed: I would like people to notice when I'm absent.<br /><br />Professionally, I think I might have this down. I'm pretty sure that every job I've ever left has had to adjust how they functioned without my contributions. Socially, though, I think I've rarely done this.<br /><br />It's easy to notice when someone is at a party or gathering, because they might be talking your ear off about their job or politics or whatever. By being there, you get to contribute to the conversations taking place and make connections with people.<br /><br />But what about when you're not there? Do people notice your absence? Do they make comments to other people that go "If only so-and-so was here..." about you? I know only a small handful of people who have ever been able to have this kind of effect on people. They tend to be gregarious, entertaining, and confident, regardless of the people around them. In my case, I don't think anyone has ever commented about how much they wished I was around when I wasn't. (I'm not wallowing in self-pity; it's just an observation.)<br /><br />This longing is, I think, universal. It's the reason we try so hard to over-educate ourselves and work to change the world. We want our influence to live on long after we've died. We want to make the history books for having achieved something great. We want people to notice that we're missing.

        We're all aware of the more high-profile celebrities who are inspiring people to make a positive change in our lives. Suze Orman teaches women the importance of getting their financial lives in order. Seth Godin inspires entrepreneurs and marketers to think in new ways. Zig Ziglar hands out lessons in the world of selling.<br /><br />These people have much greater reach than the rest of us, and that's part of their appeal. We like to be part of a much larger group, so we like to cluster around a few people that everyone else seems to be listening to.<br /><br />I think that while we give a few people who inspire us our rapt and undivided attention when they speak, we're still inspired most by those around us. It's our neighbor who lives a couple of doors down that we talk to once in a while. It's the barista at our favorite coffee shop. It's the group of people we spend all day with at work.<br /><br />While we're not as mindful of what we're learning from those close to us as what we might take away from our favorite author or motivational speaker, I think the lessons we take from these people are more ingrained and affect our day-to-day behavior much more than celebrities can. That means, of course, that we're all in positions of influence whether we like it or not. Everyone around you is learning from you.<br /><br />As a means of being introspective, the big question you should ask yourself is: what are other people learning from me. If you don't like the answer you come up with, you might consider changing what you're doing. Among other people, you're a lesson planner whether you know it or not, so take care to teach people well.

        Verizon Wireless must love me.<br /><br />My cell phone carrier charges me $60 a month for 400 minutes worth of call time and text-messages. I use maybe 20 minutes a month, generally with people who also have Verizon. They're getting that $60 a month no matter how much cost I'm incurring for them based on my usage, and I know that they're banking a ton of profit from me.<br /><br />This is common. You might have seen those commercials for one major carrier where the mother is lecturing her teenage son about rollover minutes. Her whole speech has the tone of "When I was your age, we didn't have all these extra minutes...", and a lesson about how he shouldn't take for granted all the extra cell phone time they have. In the commercials, the extra minutes are represented physically by little silver discs with clocks on them. It's silly, but solidifies an important existing surplus, part of which I contribute to each month through Verizon.<br /><br />I volunteer at a local soup kitchen, and most of the people who come in and eat are homeless or financially disadvantaged in some way. Sometimes, the diners who come in ask those the volunteers serving the food if they can borrow their cell phones to make calls.<br /><br />All people, homeless or not, have connections and need to stay in touch with other human beings. Most of them just don't have the FICO score that lets them get a contract with a major carrier, let alone the money to pay the monthly contract. Here's a philanthropic idea: let customers of major cell phone carriers donate their unused minutes, if they're available, at the end of each month, up to a certain limit. Allocate these minutes out to those who are disadvantaged and need them, but can't afford them.<br /><br />This would be great PR for Verizon or AT&T. They could give people simple, cheap phones, like the pre-paid phones you can buy at convenience stores, and give them a monthly minute budget. It would make customers feel good about their carrier, and good about themselves. More importantly, it would be helping those less fortunate.<br /><br />At the very least, it would be a welcome change from Luke Wilson and that Verizon Wireless nerd deriding one another in television commercials.

        I participate in the efforts of a local nonprofit organization, and the guy who's running everything holds weekly meetings to discuss fundraising and other challenges. He insists that everyone show up ready to brainstorm and come up with lots of ideas. In other words, he wants people to come to the meetings wearing their "thinking cap" so they can let their brilliance shine.<br /><br />I don't think it works that way. Creativity is not something that the majority of us can turn on and off just by flipping a switch. We can't control when inspiration or ideas strike; we can only learn to recognize, and do something about it, when it does strike.<br /><br />It's almost like an emotional state instead of a rational one. Instead of talking about putting on your "thinking cap", I think people should refer to it as your "thinking mood". When you get into a thinking mood, start writing stuff down. If you let people's creativity pour out on their own terms, when they're ready to do so, you'll get much better results. You just need to give them an outlet.

        And the wet mass of brain tissue between our ears is like clockwork. Which is to say, in part, that we thrive on routine and consistency, but more importantly, what's happening in our brains is a very delicate process.<br /><br />Think of what's happening in people's brains as a complicated system of little cogs and gears that all fit together, the teeth of the which are transferring motion to and from each other, and all working in concert in order to make them turn. And like clocks, we have faces that depict what's happening under the hood.<br /><br />If you want to change what a person is thinking, you're up against the clockwork. If you want to influence a person so that they agree with your point of view, you have to carefully make the message fit into the machinery that's already there. And changes in the machinery happen only at the whim and discretion of the clock. It's not up to you, no matter how much you want to change the cogs and how they work. <br /><br />If you just start jamming stuff into their heads without being careful, it's going to disrupt the flow and ultimately, the clock is going to reject it. They probably won't invite you back, either.
