                      My friend shared a great video recently, which makes an extremely important point about motivation that should be heeded by anyone in education or business.Let's assert that there are two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is the burning desire we all have, instilled in our very natures, that makes us want to do great work, to improve the world, to contribute to society, or to make a difference.

                      When daylight saving time was first observed in 1918, there was an awful lot of controversy about the idea. People and pundits came out of the woodwork to proclaim that the implementation of an hour shift in our clocks twice a year would have serious moral, religious, political, or pseudo-scientific consequences, and that it would leave future generations spiritually bankrupt in some profound way. ("Won't someone please think of the children?")I was born in 1982,...

                      When we present a person with a new thought or idea, we're often too quick to assume that the other person is going to see things our way very quickly. The problem with trying to change someone's mind in the space of a single conversation is that we don't reach conclusions...we accrue them over time. By the time we start talking to someone about a new idea, there's a good chance we already have several...

                      Fifty years ago, it was great to be in the car business. In 1953, in speech before congress, the then-CEO of General Motors said that "what's good for General Motors is good for the country." And at the time, he was probably right...but few would disput the charge that the automobile giant has shit the proverbial bed in their mission to serve the country a few times since 1953.Detroit, a former hotbed of industrial manufacturing,...

                      Like most people, I've heard rumors that it's illegal to put change into someone else parking meter. Out of curiosity, I did a little bit of digging, and while I didn't come up with a definitive answer for my own city, I found this thread on Yahoo! Answers. Seems like most of the people who commented on there harbor the same question as I do: how could putting change into someone else's meter possibly be...

                      There's two ways of looking at the eBay story in its formative years.The first way: its founder, Pierre Omidyar, was a brilliant person who had big ideas. When he first conceived of the idea for a peer-to-peer online auction site, he knew it was going to be a home run, and based on this guarantee of success, he worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into building a massive website that he knew would make...

                      Saw a great video earlier this week in which Seth Godin shares an old Zig Ziglar story about a school that had problems with student graffiti. In an effort to fight the vandalism, the principal of the school started finding students who had done something good. Then, he sent a note home with the student to their parents reading, "Your son or daughter was caught doing something good in school." The parents had to read...

                      For me, this isn't a battle between good and evil.Earlier this week, I was sitting in on a GoToMeeting call at work. The software we were using to view the lecture slides and listen to the speaker was quite good, and everything went very smoothly. One exception: every few minutes, the audio would cut out and then flare up in an oddly metallic-sounding way, briefly, before returning to normal. It was a tiny distraction, and...

                      I saw a video on YouTube the other day of a speaker addressing a large audience. During the Q&A, someone asked the speaker about politicians, and he proceeded to explain that he felt politicians tend to do things for money in exchange for championing legislation that helps the donor. In the comments on this video, someone wrote, "I'm glad someone is saying this; he's right and people need to learn it."Assuming this the speaker is...

                      While shopping for a new pair of shoes a few weeks ago, my girlfriend asked me a question I didn't expect: "Which of your feet is larger than the other?"I was caught off guard, simply because, as far as I could remember, no one has ever asked me that before.
