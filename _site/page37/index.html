        My friend shared a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G59KY7ek8Rk">great video</a> recently, which makes an extremely important point about motivation that should be heeded by anyone in education or business.<br /><br />Let's assert that there are two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is the burning desire we all have, instilled in our very natures, that makes us want to do great work, to improve the world, to contribute to society, or to make a difference. I work hard for the satisfaction of seeing things change, or of learning and growing as an individual in the process. <br /><br />Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is working for an external reward. It's what makes us work for something dangled in front of us, like good grades, merit badges, and annual salary increases.<br /><br />Keynotes:<br /><br />1. Intrinsic motivation is more powerful than extrinsic motivation.<br /><br />2. It's difficult to create intrinsic motivation in someone else (like a student, employee)<br /><br />3. Introducing extrinsic motivators (e.g. rewards) tends to displace and damage intrinsic motivation, usually irreversibly.<br /><br />Extrinsic motivation is a pretty easy way for a teacher or manager to say to their boss, "Look, see! I'm getting people to work harder!" This is why carrot-esque incentives crop up all over the place: because they give people in charge something to hide behind and a way of shouldering off responsibility.<br /><br />It's easy to be seduced by this fallacy: people like money/rewards, so maybe they'll work harder if they're dangled in front of them. This works in the short-term, but falls down over extended periods of time.<br /><br />P.S. <a href="http://www.farmville.com/">Zynga</a> has built an empire on small, extrinsic motivators. I'm not saying they don't work; only that it's not a great way to build a classroom or business for the long haul.

        When daylight saving time was first observed in 1918, there was an awful lot of controversy about the idea. People and pundits came out of the woodwork to proclaim that the implementation of an hour shift in our clocks twice a year would have serious moral, religious, political, or pseudo-scientific consequences, and that it would leave future generations spiritually bankrupt in some profound way. ("Won't someone please think of the children?")<br /><br />I was born in 1982, so people had been observing daylight saving time for well over 60 years by that time. As they say: it was like that when I got here. By the time I learned DST was supposed to ruin our civilization, it had already become part of my lifestyle.<br /><br />Too often, people forget that their children won't be exactly like them, and they'll live in a different world. We all want to leave behind a better world for our children, but people sometimes forget about the resilience factor in young people. They forget just how easily new generations adapt to new things. What looks like drastic change to you will just be the reality of tomorrow's generation. And chances are good they'll deal with it just <em>fine</em>.

        When we present a person with a new thought or idea, we're often too quick to assume that the other person is going to see things our way very quickly. The problem with trying to change someone's mind in the space of a single conversation is that we don't reach conclusions...we accrue them over time. <br /><br />By the time we start talking to someone about a new idea, there's a good chance we already have several minutes of thoughtful contemplation under our belts. We took our time, considered different perspectives, and after all of that reflection, we reach the conclusion. The person listening, on the other hand, is starting at zero.<br /><br />So how do we expect someone else to see things our way within ten seconds?

        Fifty years ago, it was great to be in the car business. In 1953, in speech before congress, the then-CEO of General Motors said that "what's good for General Motors is good for the country." And at the time, he was probably right...but few would disput the charge that the automobile giant has shit the proverbial bed in their mission to serve the country a few times since 1953.<br /><br />Detroit, a former hotbed of industrial manufacturing, now lies mostly in ruin. Joblessness is at an all-time high, crime is still a massive problem, and property values have sunk so low that you hear stories about people buying entire city blocks of residential property for a few thousand dollars. And people ask: will the city ever make a comeback?<br /><br />No one really knows, and I'm among them...but what I do know is that the people who are hoping that the automobile industry will bounce back to its former glory are most likely wrong. The days of car factories being great places to work with union wages and benefits are gone, and they're not coming back. People who are sitting by and waiting for a factory to open in Detroit, to throw open its doors and hire the good citizens of Detroit to work for them in droves, is a pipe dream, and it's not going to happen all of the sudden.<br /><br />And unfortunately, I'd assert that this isn't isolated to Detroit or to the automobile industry. Detroit has it pretty bad, but lots of cities face this kind of hardship, and they're staring an extremely bleak future in the face. No one is coming to save them anytime soon.<br /><br />That's a depressing thought for a Monday morning. But I'm an eternal optimist, so I think there's some good news in all of this. <br /><br />Part of what got the auto industry into trouble in the first place was the fact that they became too big for their own good, lost touch with their customers, and started producing things that people didn't really want. (If I get any of this wrong, let me know.) This is remarkably common these days. Larger brands have a problem: for may of them, there's a growing gulf between what they say their product delivers in their advertisements and what it actual delivers in reality.<br /><br />Coca-cola is supposed to be delivering joy in a bottle. McDonald's is selling convenience food. General Mills is using a Leprechaun to sell a cereal loaded with sugar. All good ideas, but in some ways, they're contributing to the rising number of health problems we're facing. The disparity between what marketing promises and what the product delivers erodes trust. In the wake of 2008, trust levels have sunk critically low. I don't think big brand names are going to disappear anytime soon, but they have their work cut out for them. It's not going to be as easy for them as it was 20 years ago.<br /><br />In this lack of public trust lies an opportunity. I don't believe the factories are going to come back and save us. But I do believe in the everlasting passion people have for creating things. I believe people will always find new ways of making money solving other peoples' problems. I believe in the capacity of the human mind to adapt to new problems by finding solutions. I believe that we all want what is best for ourselves, and what is best for everyone else in our local community. I believe that people will always be able to find something to believe in even when society's mores seem empty or corrupt.<br /><br />I believe that history is filled with people whose names we've never heard of, unsung people who chose to do work that mattered and to sacrifice instead of making money, and that all of us, today, are better off because of those choices. There are people today who are doing this. To them (and you, if you're one of them): thanks.

        Like most people, I've heard rumors that it's illegal to put change into someone else parking meter. Out of curiosity, I did a little bit of digging, and while I didn't come up with a definitive answer for my own city, I found <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071218202728AAmlCsD">this thread</a> on Yahoo! Answers. Seems like most of the people who commented on there harbor the same question as I do: how could putting change into someone else's meter possibly be illegal?<br /><br />Even if it is illegal in some places, whether or not the stories about homeless people being paid to feed meters for people while they are at work are true, the parking meter is a relic now. They're not around because they're the best way to raise money from cars parked there; it's because it makes the owners of those cars more prone to making mistakes.<br /><br />I don't have to elaborate on this point. In every city that I've ever visited, it's obvious that the people running city hall are interested in extracting the most money they can from people. Parking meters or spots with a 90-minute limit on them, that requires more money or moving your car when the time is up, are specifically designed to maximize breakage. <br /><br />Would it be possible to have a driver swipe their credit card when they arrive at a spot, swipe it again when they leave, and charge them for the time difference? Sure it would...that's how it works at Detroit Metro Airport for long-term lots. Meters might be a little trickier, because you have to make sure people don't pull away from a spot without swiping their card on exit or else the next person could ride their coattails...but the technology to make this kind of thing happen exists, and it's feasible to implement.<br /><br />The private sector of parking garages and lots has embraced ease of use and convenience. Municipalities, on the other hand, have not, since that would require investment in new infrastructure that would, ultimately, reduce almost any city's revenue from parking violations. And no city is that dumb. <br /><br />What this ignores is the human element of each individual driver. People can take a lot of pressure, but getting a parking ticket seems to make most people lose their cool extremely quickly. I think people feel it's a blunt reminder of just how much control we lack over our lives in modern society, and while most people ignore that most of the time, a parking ticket is the perfect straw to break the camel's back.<br /><br />I'd like to think there would be benefits (not necessarily financial ones) in implementing a system that costs a little more, but keeps people in control. It makes it <em>easy</em> to update the time on the meter, or better yet, makes the updating completely unnecessary. I don't think it's a stretch to say it would have a positive impact on peoples' psyches. But, alas, the system is broken, and on purpose, and we're stuck with it for the long-haul, until someone figures out a new system with incentives that work for everyone.<br /><br />Maybe it's one of those things that will help nudge some people towards the expansion of public transportation.<br /><br />P.S. I thought of an idea for a mobile app which I called "Meter Beater" which would act as an egg timer for people parked in metered spots. Turns out <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/meter-beater/id333253458?mt=8">that exact thing</a> exists for iPhones.

        There's two ways of looking at the eBay story in its formative years.<br /><br />The first way: its founder, Pierre Omidyar, was a brilliant person who had big ideas. When he first conceived of the idea for a peer-to-peer online auction site, he knew it was going to be a home run, and based on this guarantee of success, he worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into building a massive website that he knew would make him a millionaire and put him atop an Internet empire that would later enable Meg Whitman to run for governor of California.<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />The second way: Pierre Omidyar had a tiny spark of an idea. He thought it might work. Because he was the kind of person to start something at whittle away at it patient, and because he knew how to program on the web, he coded up a small prototype of his site. As it grew from humble beginnings to one of the most highly-trafficked sites in the Internet, he made mistakes, stumbled, but ultimately came out on top.<br /><br />Most people think of the story the first way. I don't know about you, but that makes the very thought of starting anything really scary.<br /><br />My guess is that the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes, but it's probably a whole lot closer to the second story. And that's good news, because the second story is much more <em>accessible</em>. The notion that Pierre was just a person who had small ideas, and that he was in the habit of making those ideas happen, is one worth dwelling upon at length. Because if you start to see it that way, then you begin to see the potential in tiny ideas without guarantees of big payoffs, and you starting seeing the value of doing small tasks in incremental bursts.<br /><br />I'd be willing to bet that Pierre is a very curious person by nature, and it was probably his curiosity that drove him to do things. Here's the mindset: <em>this sounds like a silly idea...but I'm going to do it anyway</em>. As a person, Pierre was just a guy who <em>did things</em>, and one just happened to pay off.<br /><br />Most of us don't have the capacity to be brilliant all the time, have huge ideas all the time, and work really hard all the time. But each and every one of us has the ability to take small ideas, start them, and chip away at them. We can all be whittlers.

        Saw a great <a href="http://vimeo.com/14950095">video</a> earlier this week in which Seth Godin shares an old Zig Ziglar story about a school that had problems with student graffiti. In an effort to fight the vandalism, the principal of the school started finding students who had done something good. Then, he sent a note home with the student to their parents reading, "Your son or daughter was caught doing something good in school." The parents had to read it, sign it, and send it back with their student the next day. According to the story, within a few month's time, the graffiti had all but disappeared.<br /><br />Stop finding the darkness and trying to stamp it out. Instead, find the bright spots and figure out how to make more of them.

        For me, this isn't a battle between good and evil.<br /><br />Earlier this week, I was sitting in on a GoToMeeting call at work. The software we were using to view the lecture slides and listen to the speaker was quite good, and everything went very smoothly. One exception: every few minutes, the audio would cut out and then flare up in an oddly metallic-sounding way, briefly, before returning to normal. It was a tiny distraction, and I had no trouble putting it out of my mind.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />In movies, the inner debate between right and wrong is often personified using a cartoon angel and devil on the character's shoulder. With the GoToMeeting software issue, there's something like this happening in my head, but since it's not a matter of good versus evil, it isn't quite right to call them an angel and a devil. <br /><br />For this discussion, let's call them the hippo and the tiger. Two opposing sides of my brain, constantly at war with one another, vying for my attention. The hippo is telling me to ignore the problems I see in the world. "Nothing's broken here," he insists stubbornly, all the time. Sometimes I go to start my car in the morning and, for reasons unknown to me, my car alarm goes off when I turn the key, even though I unlocked it using the remote. "The problem isn't with the car," the hippo says. "It's with you." In the web conference I spoke of earlier, he's the one telling me to ignore the fact that there's an issue that's causing weird audio problems in the software. <br /><br />In short, the hippo would have me believe that any time I grapple with technology I don't fully understand and lose the battle, that it's entirely my fault. The hippo isn't interested in making me feel bad; he's just trying to keep me from expending lots of energy getting frustrated with things. He wants me to adapt to the problem and move on with my life. (Needless to say, a lot of engineering firms in this country would make generous campaign contributions to the hippo if he ever ran for political office.)<br /><br />On the other hand, there is the tiger, and the tiger is <em>pissed</em>. The tiger sees everything in the world as being broken. Even if something is being done well, there's always a way it can be done better. When I'm struggling to figure out how to find information I need on the IRS's website, the tiger is inside of me, screaming about how poorly organized and unhelpful it is.<br /><br />The tiger, in a nutshell, is all about changing things, usually for the better. It feels that technology should work for people, not the other way around. It's the fire inside of every visionary and entrepreneur that sees beyond the world for what is and can immediately pinpoint what's possible. The tiger wants me to fix the world around me so I <em>won't</em> have to adapt, and secretly, he's hoping I help lots of other people with the same problem in the process.<br /><br />Listening to these two animals is a matter of balancing them. Too much hippo, and you risk making yourself miserable blaming yourself for every problem you encounter. Too much tiger, and you also risk making yourself miserable by being overwhelmed by how broken society and its systems seem at times.<br /><br />There are times when the tiger yells at all of us. Take the DMV, for example. It's almost impossible to spend any time at the DMV without the tiger on my shoulder popping up and pointing out all of the stuff they seem to be doing wrong. It's seemingly bureaucracy gone made...at least to any outsider.<br /><br />Most of us spend our days listening to the hippo. We don't go looking for disquiet, and even when it finds us, we try and ignore it. After all, acknowledging that there's a problem, even inwardly, puts us on the hook for trying to find a solution for it. When you see something that's broken, it creates a mental itch that begs to be scratched. When we set out to satiate the tiger, it opens us up for failure. This is uncomfortable...hence, we try to avoid it.<br /><br />This is the place in the analogy where a hackneyed motivational speaker might tell you to "embrace your inner tiger" or some such nonsense. I'm not going to say that. What I will say, instead, is that in my own personal experience, listening to the tiger in my brain tends to lead to me doing things, which makes me happier than listening to the hippo and proceeding to do nothing.<br /><br />But, as the old saying goes: everything in moderation.

        I saw a video on YouTube the other day of a speaker addressing a large audience. During the Q&A, someone asked the speaker about politicians, and he proceeded to explain that he felt politicians tend to do things for money in exchange for championing legislation that helps the donor. In the comments on this video, someone wrote, "I'm glad someone is saying this; he's right and people need to learn it."<br /><br />Assuming this the speaker is correct (at least to some degree), isn't it still a little silly to attribute the persistence of this problem to people not knowing? That's akin to saying that some people smoke cigarettes just because they haven't yet learned that they're bad for their health.<br /><br />In a lot of cases, not knowing is not the true cause of the problem. The political machine in this country is probably far from squeaky clean, but most people feel this is true already. And the danger of oversimplifying any problem by chocking it up the fact that most people just don't know is that you're going to devise a solution based on informing people, when they're already informed. Such an approach is unlikely to change anyone's behavior.<br /><br />It's much more difficult to create a strategy to influence people when it's predicated on the assumption that people already know. Telling people facts is easy, but telling them where to go once they've got the facts is much harder.

        While shopping for a new pair of shoes a few weeks ago, my girlfriend asked me a question I didn't expect: "Which of your feet is larger than the other?"<br /><br />I was caught off guard, simply because, as far as I could remember, no one has ever asked me that before. The first batch of questions back were, "Is that possible? Is that common? Do a lot of people have slight differences in the sizes of their two feet?"<br /><br />Turns out it's not that uncommon. The size difference varies, and usually, it's not big enough for most people to notice when they put on shoes. But after having it pointed out to me, I did notice that the shoe on my right foot was slightly tighter than the one on my left. Apparently I have a bigger right foot.<br /><br />So, just out of curiosity, why hasn't an online shoe retailer created a feature that lets people order a pair of shoes that mix and match sizes? It isn't everything, but surely somewhere in the long tail of fashion footwear there's a group of people who have enough of a size difference between their feet that they'd gladly pay for the convenience of two shoes that varied in size?
