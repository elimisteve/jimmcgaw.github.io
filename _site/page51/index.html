                      I think you are. I'm sure you've had an idea, an inkling, a thought of something you could do online. I'm not talking about those online scams that promise you'll get checks for doing absolutely no work. Instead, I'm referring to those conversations that come up when you're out to dinner with friends. Those times when a good idea strikes you and you wonder, "Is anyone doing that?"Chances are, you Googled it to find out...

                      And when I do, what am I going to find? It's not any big secret any longer that companies are Googling prospective hires in an effort to learn more about them when they apply for jobs. But have you ever bothered to Google your own name and see what comes up? How about under the image results? No one's going to find that MySpace photo of you with a cigarette hanging out of your mouth,...

                      There's a Goodwill a few blocks from me that I go to a few times a week, mostly because they tend to have a respectable book selection. (It's also interesting to browse the old CDs they have there, which now seems akin to thumbing through my parent's collection of old LPs.) Since the books are cheap, I find that it's a pretty cost effective way for me to sample lots of more popular titles just...

                      I've heard more than one casual mention in the past few weeks about what will happen "when America goes the way of Greece." Because we now live in an interconnected economy, thanks to technology, a major economic crisis in one country is sure to spread out across the rest of the world, impacting other countries through some kind of ripple effect. The riots of Greece will soon plague Manhattan and the streets of Madrid.Certainly, there...

                      I got an email from a programmer with a blog who wanted to post an excerpt from the book I wrote, and he was writing to me to ask for my permission to do so. And my first reaction was to be flattered that someone would want to quote anything that I had written. I was just glad someone had read it and that they liked it enough to want to share it themselves.As I...

                      An idea for big businesses struggling through hard times: you probably have a rule book in your possession that was compiled in order to keep customers from getting too much out of you.Take Blockbuster: they have a rental policy about their in-store rentals that spans several pages, so long that even the employees working in their stores don't understand all the legal-sounding garbage in its pages. They did this because there were a few movies...

                      If I have an arch nemesis, it's the fellow who wrote this book, aptly titled The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet is Killing Our Culture. Yep, you read the title correctly: in the era of the Long Tail, there's a guy who not only believes that there's a few downsides, but that believes that it's alldownsides.I was drawn to the book because it harbors an opinion that is the polar opposite of my...

                      That's what they do so well. Several times a day, I end up visiting Amazon.com, browsing books, just hoping that they recommend a book to me that sounds so good it gives me an excuse to buy it. If you go to Amazon looking for something very specific, you'll find it pretty quickly. Entering almost any book title or author will return very accurate results.

                      According to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, if you sign up to receive emails from a website, they have to include an "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email. This is so companies have to continually try and earn the right to our attention. If their emails ever become more of an annoyance than an interest, we have the right to remove ourselves from their list.According to the CAN-SPAM Act, once a customer clicks...

                      That goes for all markets. The stock market, the labor market, the job market, and the market for anything else you can think of. That means it's never going to be as easy as you think.There's lot of books about how to find a job, how to invest in stocks and make money, how to get a book published, and so on.
