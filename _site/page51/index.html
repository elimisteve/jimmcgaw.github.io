        I think you are. I'm sure you've had an idea, an inkling, a thought of something you could do online. I'm not talking about those online scams that promise you'll get checks for doing absolutely no work. Instead, I'm referring to those conversations that come up when you're out to dinner with friends. Those times when a good idea strikes you and you wonder, "Is anyone doing that?"<br /><br />Chances are, you Googled it to find out if it existed. Is anyone writing about that? Is there a book on the topic? Is there an online store selling that? Would anyone be interested in my advice about this? It's an exciting moment when you have a good idea and discover that nobody has done it yet.<br /><br />When you reach that point, your next questions might be: "Is anyone searching for that on Google? If so, how many people?"<br /><br />Here's how you can find out: use the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">Google Adwords Keyword Tool</a>. The URL is: https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal. (Bookmark it, because the page itself isn't available in Google's search pages and you'll want to keep it handy the next time inspiration strikes.) When you first get to the page, you'll be asked to enter some letters as a security check. They're just making sure you're a human being and not some automated machine trying to suck down a ton of Google's data. <br /><br />Once you're past that, enter some keywords or phrases related to your idea into the box and then hit search. Google will click and whir, and then return the number of times (if any) it's been entered into Google per month. It will also return a ton of other results for related keywords and phrases, which may offer you further insight or inspiration.<br /><br />(If you're having trouble figuring out what your initial keywords or phrases should be, I'd recommend playing with <a href="http://labs.google.com/sets">Google Sets</a> for some inspiration.)<br /><br />Hopefully the tool helps answer your questions or offers some guidance. Maybe you came up another, slightly different idea in the meantime, or maybe your original idea was enhanced by some of the results. <br /><br />Now the tricky part - figuring out how to make it happen. I'm a web developer for a living, but here's my confession: <em>you don't need my help to put most of your really great ideas into action</em>. That might have been true in 2001, but technology has come a long way since then. In order to sell stuff as an online merchant, to create an online presence for yourself so that maybe someone will be impressed and hire you, to share yourself or your art with others with radical honesty, to strike out on your own and start working for yourself instead of an employer, to offer your expertise or insight in your line of work, to create communities in social networks...it's pretty easy for anyone with basic computer skills, and the cost is negligible. Very often, it's completely free.<br /><br />To make an idea for the web work, here's the three things I think you need:<br /><br />1. Access to, and understanding of, technology.<br />2. A good, not great, idea. (Great ideas are welcome.)<br />3. Faith, perseverance, and good ol' fashioned <em>cajones</em>.<br /><br />We just covered technology, so that's (probably) not a limitation you're facing. And if you're still reading at this point, chances are good you already have an idea. You might even have lots of 'em. Coming up with a good idea might be seem a little tricky, but it's just a matter of recognizing them when your brain comes up with them. We all have ideas, but most of us are wired not to pay attention to them. Pick the one you like best to start.<br /><br />The third one is the hardest one, and it's the reason a lot of good ideas never see the light of day. (Disclaimer: the "light of day" doesn't mean "success and riches of a bloated plutocrat".) The execution is what really matters. It's making the decision to follow through on your idea, sticking to it long enough so it has a chance to succeed, and believing that it will. That can be hard work.<br /><br />For anyone who might need friendly advice or have questions about Internet stuff, see me afterward.<br /><br />P.S. I started this post by offering you a means of analyzing what people are looking for on Google...but in a way, that's me leading the witness (you). I don't think <em>anyone</em> was searching for "dog whisperer" back in 2002, but it seems to have worked out for Cesar Millan. Too often people don't know what they're looking for until you offer it to them.

        And when I do, what am I going to find? It's not any big secret any longer that companies are Googling prospective hires in an effort to learn more about them when they apply for jobs. But have you ever bothered to Google your own name and see what comes up? How about under the image results? No one's going to find that MySpace photo of you with a cigarette hanging out of your mouth, looking like you desperately need Visine, right?<br /><br />Incriminating photos aside, there's another opportunity here: not just to eliminate the bad stuff, but to build a whole lot of good stuff, too. You can write interesting stuff, dazzle people with the photos on your Flickr account, and create a Meetup local group where you get together with local cycling enthusiasts and hit the open roads.<br /><br />You lead an interesting life, right? (Outside of the "eyedrop-worthy" parts of it, anyway.) Now, before you're looking for your next job, is the perfect time to prove it online, by filling out the long tail of your reputation in the search engines with some juicy tidbits about who you really are. Figure out the story you want to tell, and then tell it with all your might.

        There's a Goodwill a few blocks from me that I go to a few times a week, mostly because they tend to have a respectable book selection. (It's also interesting to browse the old CDs they have there, which now seems akin to thumbing through my parent's collection of old LPs.) Since the books are cheap, I find that it's a pretty cost effective way for me to sample lots of more popular titles just to see what will stick to my brain. I've learned from this, for example, that as a business writer, Jack Welch is not that interesting.<br /><br />Every other Wednesday, they have a "Half off everything in the store" kind of sale, so the price of each book falls to well under a dollar. All paperbacks are 40 cents. At that price, I'll buy almost anything that I've heard of and felt I might be interested in. If I buy 10 books and one of them is good, the $4 I spent is still a quarter of what I would have spent on one new book from Borders.<br /><br />What I decided to do more recently was buy books for other people. There's a small handful of books that I've perused and felt were insightful, prudent, and interesting, and I would like nothing more than to share them with someone else, in the hopes that it would turn on lights for them, too. <br /><br />I found a copy of one of my favorite books about selling and salesmanship a few weeks ago, bought the copy of it, and left it out on a public bench where I often see stacks of abandoned books that are picked up by my city's myriad homeless. Is it going to teach any of them how to get a job in sales? Probably not. But I'm a big fan of passing the ideas forward.<br /><br />Of course, you could argue that, at 40 cents a book, the homeless could buy the books themselves. They could certainly go to Goodwill and find the stuff they want to read. But there's a difference between going out and finding a book to read among the thousands of titles in a bookstore, versus someone handing you a book directly with a hearty recommendation. I'm not always handing them out directly to people, but I make sure it will end up in someone's hands, with a good chance they'll read it.<br /><br />When someone hands me a book, and it ends up being a good one, it's a pleasant surprise. It's like an answer to a question you didn't even think to ask, which is something we all need to seek out.

        I've heard more than one casual mention in the past few weeks about what will happen "when America goes the way of Greece." Because we now live in an interconnected economy, thanks to technology, a major economic crisis in one country is sure to spread out across the rest of the world, impacting other countries through some kind of ripple effect. The riots of Greece will soon plague Manhattan and the streets of Madrid.<br /><br />Certainly, there is an impact, but I question the severity of it. Sure, I don't see the United States having a massive, booming economy anytime in the near future. But I think the world economy is too complex a system, governed by too many random variables, for anyone to draw a large, far-reaching conclusion like that with any certainty.<br /><br />Usually when someone brings this up to me, I ask them, "What's your 'Plan B'?" I tell that if they really feel we're headed for complete financial ruin, and are willing to expound on that thought in conversation, then they must have made arrangements to deal with this problem when it finally hits our economy. So far, I've only met one person who actually has a plan.<br /><br />I'm all in favor of discussing what <em>could</em> happen, to a degree, because lots of things could happen. Life seems to take a certain glee in throwing us curve balls, and often when we least suspect them. This seems to have created a Pavlovian association in people's minds: in the absence of total stability (spoiler alert: that doesn't really exist anywhere), people seem to brace themselves for the absolute worst. (Or at least talk about it.) An awareness of what's possible is good. But treating unlikely possibilities as certainties isn't. It's wasteful, because we're all limited in what we can plan for.<br /><br />If someone asks me what I think about how the situation in Greece will affect the US economy, I simply shrug and tell them, "I don't know." At least I'm honest.

        I got an email from a programmer with a blog who wanted to post an excerpt from the book I wrote, and he was writing to me to ask for my permission to do so. And my first reaction was to be flattered that someone would want to quote anything that I had written. I was just glad someone had read it and that they liked it enough to want to share it themselves.<br /><br />As I was hammering out an email response to him, I started to think about what my publisher might think of this. And it occurred me to that they probably wouldn't like it a whole lot. They're one of those publishing companies that holds a lot of "traditional" viewpoints, and so I'm sure they see the book as intellectual property, and copying anything from it would be infringement.<br /><br />I started to think about it. I suppose if someone went to the farthest possible extreme, it would be them taking the entire contents of the book and putting it up online, for free, on a blog someplace. (Actually, you can <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uNDzT2Q2to8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=django+e-commerce&ei=RVPmS-qLDqiKkASdsrnkCQ&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false">read half of it on Google books</a>...Google never asked me about that.) And if you start Google the book's title, here are the results that come up from Google Suggest:<br /><br /><img style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 274px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S-ZTz9nvJ-I/AAAAAAAAAMk/lHKwMWf7jkU/s320/django_ecommerce_google_suggest.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br /><br />From the look of things, it looks like most of the people who are searching for it are looking for how they can <em>steal</em> it.<br /><br />Try as I may, though, I can't get my head about the opinion that this is a <em>bad</em> thing. I guess you could argue that for every person who downloads an illegal copy, I get one less book sale and so directly, it's costing me money. You could argue it's a zero-sum game. <br /><br />But the way I see it, the more people that read it, the more people there are who might use the information to create web projects using those technologies. Provided the book is good enough, perhaps it will start conversations and get people building things using the framework and programming language. And (if you need a selfish motive on my part) maybe one of them will happen to be super brilliant and start a company that will go on to be successful, and maybe one day he or she will hire me to work for them.<br /><br />I know that's a stretch, but I have a sense of propriety. I didn't write the book to get rich. The only people who can count on making money on a book they wrote are the people who made money from their last one, and I definitely don't fall into that category. I did it for reputation, if nothing else, and the satisfaction of knowing (at least believing) that it might help someone else learn.<br /><br />The worst thing I can see happening is someone taking its content, mangling it so that it's technically incorrect, and then both posting it online and attributing it to me. But I can't see why anyone would bother to do that, shy of a personal vendetta.<br /><br />The enemy of any artist isn't piracy, it's obscurity.

        An idea for big businesses struggling through hard times: you probably have a rule book in your possession that was compiled in order to keep customers from getting too much out of you.<br /><br />Take Blockbuster: they have a rental policy about their in-store rentals that spans several pages, so long that even the employees working in their stores don't understand all the legal-sounding garbage in its pages. They did this because there were a few movies that didn't get returned on time, and some that didn't get returned at all. To deal with the misfit renters, they started making rules, instilled fines, all in the interest of keeping transgressions to a minimum. Or, more likely, in the interest of the bottom line.<br /><br />Zappos.com has an extremely liberal return policy. Buy a pair of shoes, and if you feed them to your dog, you can send them back, at Zappos' expense, for a replacement pair. Does Zappos get anything out of this? No. They lose money on customers that do this. But the ones that do are few and far between, and more important than that, they understand that the lifetime value of a customer is worth much more than fighting to keep a single sale.<br /><br />Blockbuster, along with many other companies, might still need the rulebook. But they can make it a bulleted list of no more than five bulleted items, very short and to the point. Make them entertaining, and post them on the wall. When your past puts you into a quagmire, it might be time to cut it loose.

        If I have an arch nemesis, it's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Amateur-MySpace-user-generated-destroying/dp/0385520816/">fellow who wrote this book</a>, aptly titled <em>The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet is Killing Our Culture</em>. Yep, you read the title correctly: in the era of the Long Tail, there's a guy who not only believes that there's a few downsides, but that believes that it's <em>all</em>downsides.<br /><br />I was drawn to the book because it harbors an opinion that is the polar opposite of my own. I actually read parts of it in the hopes that I would gain some valuable new perspective on things. I didn't. I just learned that the author is quite a bitter person who's annoyed at the way markets are shifting in a world where the Internet exists.<br /><br />My girlfriend saw the author photo and remarked, "He looks like the villian in something." And in the story of my life, he certainly is.<br /><br />But he's just some crusty pundit who got a book deal, and I never have to meet him, and I don't have to concern myself with his point of view...right?<br /><br />As it happens, no. I was having coffee with a friend of mine the other night. In passing, he brought up the subject of digital publishing, and began expressing a lamentation about the rise of blogs and the fall of the traditional publishing house. When I asked him why he felt that way, he said, "At least there were some standards that writing had to meet if you published a book. Now anyone can write anything they please."<br /><br />Traditional publishers act like filters. They decide what gets printed and distributed, and what doesn't. Because you can only print so many books per year, they'd better be good. Of course, now any writer can self-publish a book, digital or otherwise, and any idiot can start writing a blog. (Hi!)<br /><br />I believe that there should be standards for writers and the works they produce. But here's where my friend and I differ: <em>I don't think the standards should be left up to the publishers</em>. As businesses, book publishers spent many years growing fat off of the work of writers because they owned the means of distribution. Which was good for them while in lasted. But now, why can't readers decide for themselves what they choose to read and not read? If someone is a terrible writer, and can't form a coherent thought to save their lives, then no one is going to read what they're writing. As readers, we don't need a publisher to screen out the bad stuff.<br /><br />My friend generally agreed with that point of view, but felt this would result in a state of overwhelm. If everyone can produce books, then how are we, as readers, supposed to find the good ones? Constraints of the traditional publishing world acted as a filter: only "good" books got published, so there was less clutter in the marketplace. But what about a world in which almost every person is writing? How do you decide what to read?<br /><br />Asking how we can remove the bad clutter from the marketplace is asking the wrong question. It's not possible to restructure the Internet so that only good stuff is available, and trying to do so will only waste valuable energy. You can, however, figure out how to find the good stuff for yourself. Even better, if you figure out how to help other people do that, there might be a really good business model in it.

        That's what they do so well. Several times a day, I end up visiting Amazon.com, browsing books, just hoping that they recommend a book to me that sounds so good it gives me an excuse to buy it. <br /><br />If you go to Amazon looking for something very specific, you'll find it pretty quickly. Entering almost any book title or author will return very accurate results. You might be surprised, but that's actually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">remarkably difficult thing</a> to do well, and Amazon does it with amazing precision.<br /><br />Even more difficult than that, however, is to help people browse, and this is where Amazon really shines. More often than not, I come to Amazon looking for a book on a particular subject or idea, and sometimes, I have very little in the way of search keywords to go on. It takes very little time for me to arrive at a book that satisfies the need I was looking for. <br /><br />Finding specific items by searching for the name is comparatively simple. It's just a matter of matching the search text with the text of the products. But allowing people to browse around is based on more than product data; it comes from community. Using Amazon to find books that I'm looking for, I'm using their product recommendations, which are based on orders by past customers. It's based on the items in customer wish lists. I use the reviews to gauge how good a book is, and to seek out direction from people who seem to know more about the subject matter than I do.<br /><br />All of that customer data is Amazon's biggest asset, and they leverage it very well. That's why I'd be willing to bet that Amazon's stock is probably a pretty safe investment, at least into the foreseeable future. <br /><br />In online marketing circles, getting a customer to make a purchase is called "converting", but I like the term closing a whole lot better. If you're good at something (and honest), then you don't need to use a euphemism to describe what you're doing. Amazon is a salesman, and they close me at least once a week. They can guess at what I might want to read better than most of my friends can. The "sales associates" walking hurriedly through Borders desperately trying to avoid eye contact with customers don't have a prayer.

        According to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, if you sign up to receive emails from a website, they have to include an "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email. This is so companies have to continually try and earn the right to our attention. If their emails ever become more of an annoyance than an interest, we have the right to remove ourselves from their list.<br /><br />According to the CAN-SPAM Act, once a customer clicks that link, they must be taken to a page where their email will be removed from the system. You can ask them why they chose to leave (if you must), but after they confirm the request, you have 10 days to remove them from your system and not email that person ever again. (unless they subscribe again.)<br /><br />Here's the question: during those 10 days, should a company continue to send them emails, in the hopes of converting them back into a subscriber?<br /><br />Marketing is not my department, but regardless, I'm going to weigh in on the matter: You should stop sending emails to that person <em>as soon as they ask to be removed</em>. <br /><br />There's a grace period of 10 days that exists from a legal standpoint, but the technology is there to make this kind of thing almost instantaneous. If I click an "Unsubscribe" link in an email, I know that it doesn't take long for this information to trickle through your system and update what's in the database. You can't fool me, man...I'm a programmer.<br /><br />Some marketers like to believe that it makes sense to treat people who have unsubscribed as a "warm market". Instead of trying to figure out what made them leave in the first place, they take liberties with people's permission, figuring that it can't hurt to send emails to that person for the next 10 days. If 1 person out of a 1000 ends up changing their minds, they feel (notice I didn't say "think") it was worth it.<br /><br />This is not a good way to try and win back people who have opted to leave. They've turned their back on you. What you're doing, as a marketer, is ensuring that the doorknob hits them in the ass on the way out.

        That goes for all markets. The stock market, the labor market, the job market, and the market for anything else you can think of. That means it's never going to be as easy as you think.<br /><br />There's lot of books about how to find a job, how to invest in stocks and make money, how to get a book published, and so on. All of this advice might be very prudent, but you can never expect to open up a book, follow the instructions, and achieve the goal you wanted. This is because if it's easy, lots of people do it, and if everyone's doing it, it isn't unique. <br /><br />Even if it takes effort, a lot of people might still do it, and the market will quickly adjust itself so that it no longer rewards what those people are doing.<br /><br />If you create a resume based on advice from a book on resume writing, don't be shocked when you don't hear back from that employer. And I wouldn't expect the secrets of the stock market to exist between the covers of that "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" book series, either. Anyone can follow instructions. Most people happily do just that. Almost always, it doesn't get them the result that they wanted.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde once wrote: "Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught." But an important corollary to that maxim is that anything worth knowing can be learned.
