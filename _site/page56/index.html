        As soon as a new avenue of media opens up, there's inevitably a bunch of critics that want to get rid of it or control it in some way. Usually, the debate heats up over time, and as more pressure is applied, a compromised is reached.<br /><br />Cinema emerged in the 1920s, and about 40 years later, the MPAA established its ratings system of G, PG, PG-13, and so forth, so that viewers could know beforehand whether the content of the film was appropriate given the ages of those who were going to see it.<br /><br />Television became widespread in the 1950s, and in the mid-1990s--also about 40 years later--a similar ratings system was developed for TV shows. <br /><br />The Internet has been in use by the general public since (circa) 1994. That means we can expect search engines to start putting parental guidance ratings on their search results by the year 2034. But everything seems to happen faster on the Internet, so I'm guessing we might start to see it in the next decade. Honestly, I'm surprised we haven't seen them already.

      <div class="content">
        If you're driving around and you see a bunch of patio furniture that you like on the deck of someone's house, here's how you can steal it (hear me out on this one): go on Craigslist, and preview (preview, don't post) a listing under the "Free" section on behalf of that person, saying "I live at this address, and have these items sitting on my deck that I want to get rid of. Please, someone come take them away." Print up the screenshot of the preview and then, when you figure the person isn't home, either during a workday or a busy Saturday, post the post for real (make sure you can get there before anyone else), then show up and start carrying the stuff away. If anyone questions you, show them the copy of the post you printed up.<br /><br />Now, here's the part where I tell you that this is just an idea, it might not be a good one, do it at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you end up in jail, blah blah. I put in a disclaimer that waives any legal responsibility on my part, so you can't point at this blog post and name me, the writer, as an accomplice, or the mastermind who concocted up this scheme. (And yes, I get to call myself a "mastermind" in this post. Want to see my artistic license?)<br /><br />Legally, I'm probably in the clear, but what about the <em>social</em> responsibility? Bloggers offer their ideas to people, and if they're bad, they hide behind the "I'm not responsible if you do this" spiel. This is like the cigarette companies selling tobacco. Sure, they're not breaking the law, but I'd argue that they're doing something socially irresponsible. I think the individual who chooses to smoke bears most of the responsibility for their actions, but that doesn't let the companies off the hook entirely.<br /><br />If you're a writer, you are an idea merchant, and if you're thinking of sharing an idea that requires fine print, you might want to stop and think about the message you're sending to people. Maybe present the idea in a different way. Instead of "Here's how to steal from people using Craigslist", how about "Here's a potential misuse of Craigslist, and why you should lock down your patio furniture"?<br /><br />And if the idea you want to present still needs that fine print, maybe you should consider not sharing the idea in the first place.

        There's a lady who plays the harp on the street in the town where I live. She's really quite good. She uses an amplifier to make the sound of the instrument carry quite a distance; you can hear her playing almost a full city block away. She's really quite good; people stop to listen to her play. In her repertoire she has a lot of cover songs; it's interesting to hear pop music played via a harp.<br /><br />Next to her, she always has a table with a stack of CDs that you can buy if you want to take her music home with you. They're nothing fancy; just CD-Rs in a thin case with her picture and <a href="http://www.a1harp.com/">contact info</a> on them.  The CDs themselves cost ten dollars. (I happily bought one, in case you're wondering.)<br /><br />If you're trying to make money just by selling CDs--which is something that very, very few musicians have been able to do in the past--then it makes perfect sense to charge people ten dollars for the CD. <br /><br />But what if your goal is to reach as many people as you can with your music, to share your art, and inspire as big an audience as you can? Or to use the CDs as promotional materials, so the word spreads and more people know who you are, and want to hire you to perform at their event? In that case, shouldn't the CD be free?<br /><br />CEOs don't charge a dollar when people ask for their business card at events.

        That goes triple in Vegas. And you know what kids like? Dinosaurs.<br /><br />I wonder, then: why isn't there a big house of mechanical dinosaurs that people can visit in Las Vegas? Why isn't there a dinosaur-themed casino, with jungle exhibits and big fire-breathing robots and slot machines with T-Rexes plastered all over them? Why isn't there a <em>Cirque du Dinosaur</em> show people can go see when they're wasted?<br /><br />You might say that dinosaurs lack the glamor of Paris or Caesar's Palace. Explain, then, what Treasure Island is doing on the strip?

        <a href="http://www.chihuly.com/">Dale Chihuly</a> is a world-renowned glassblower. What's interesting about Dale is that he's doesn't just make money by creating great glass artwork and then selling the pieces, but he also draws a crowd that watches him work. People are interested in the <em>performance</em> part of him creating his art, as well as the art itself.<br /><br />That's interesting. There are a lot of wineries around Santa Barbara, where I live. Some of them distinguish themselves by having very odd and unique-looking bottles. Another way of getting attention is by holding an event, like the grape-stomping festival that my girlfriend and I attended a few months ago. <br /><br />I'd say a winery should hold a glass-blowing event. Get a local glass blower to produce some fancy bottles for you, fill them with wine, and then hold a big showing of the glass blower for people to come watch. Remind those who attend that they can <em>buy</em> a bottle of wine, whose bottle was produced by the glass blower, at that event.<br /><br />Offer to put the glass blower's name on the bottle and offer him a portion of what you make from the wine sales. I think you could find a glass artisan willing to do it.

        Whatever you aspire to do with your life, get started right now. This very moment. You might be at work, so maybe you can't produce anything, but start thinking about it. Starting brainstorming the ideas in your head; write them down if you can.<br /><br />Start that blog, post a post that you think will inspire people, share a business idea with a friend, project a monthly budget for the next year.<br /><br />There's nothing separating you from those who get things done except for the mere act of doing. A lack of money, a lack of experience, or a lack of a perfect idea is not any kind of excuse to put things off. <br /><br />Go get started.

        If so, your days are numbered.<br /><br />Time was, only so many books could be published per year. Each one had to be printed and distributed to bookstores, so as a publisher, there was a cap on how many you could produce each year. So, the name of the game became being very selective. If you publish a book, you better be reasonably sure it will sell well. It gave them license to discriminate.<br /><br />Now we can keep blogs for free, and self-publish books ourselves. With Amazon, we don't need the big publishing houses, so we can eschew them and their arbitrary standards. They've been pretty vocal about how this isn't fair, about how digital books, like those on the Kindle, are a threat to their industry.<br /><br />And they're right; they <em>do</em> pose a threat to the <em>industry</em>, but what it doesn't do is pose a threat to the <em>people who write</em>. I grew up wanting to be a writer, wanting to share ideas with an audience (however big or small that audience might be). The fact that I don't need to convince some big publishing house that my ideas are financially solvent before I can offer them to the world is exciting to me.<br /><br />You don't get to tell me how or what to write any longer. "Marketable" no longer equates to "fiscally solvent".

        Here's an idea: pick a topic that interests you (preferably one you're familiar with), find a venue that will let you stand up for free, and then offer to speak on that topic for free. Post fliers, or find local organizations that are willing to tell their members about you because what you're talking about is relevant to what they do. You don't have to do a lot. Just spend an hour or so making calls or walking around telling people about it. And then, when it's showtime, get up there and speak with passion. Share your thoughts with people.<br /><br />Why not do this? Because: "Nobody will show up". That might happen, in which case, you're off the hook. You just go home and go to sleep that night. I'd say that just means you need to refine your fliers, tell a few more people, or perhaps you need to tweak the topic slightly. But I still think anyone (that includes you) should consider doing it.<br /><br />It's a chicken and the egg problem that's responsible for so much inertia that lots of people never try speaking up for what they believe in. Don't speak, because no one will listen. Don't write because no one will read. Or, more generally, don't create because no one will appreciate.<br /><br />Appreciation always follows creation, not the other way around. There's no guarantee that anyone will appreciate what you say, but it's up to you to give them the opportunity to do so.

        In the movie The Wizard of Oz, I remember how strange and giddy the inside of the Emerald City was, when the singing quartet Dorothy and company finally arrive to see the wizard. After a bunch of silliness at the front door, they get inside and are greeted by throngs of singing people all dressed in green, an arena full of marvels, horses that change colors, and spa treatments. It's all brightly colored, shiny, and crazy.<br /><br />A few years ago, I joked with a friend of mine that the inside of Google's headquarters in Mountain View was probably a lot like the inside of that Emerald City. The only part of the story that didn't fit, I thought, was the Wizard himself, who was little more than a confused old man who was masquerading as mysterious, all-powerful leader.<br /><br />Last December, there was an interview with the current president of Google, Eric Schmidt. In response to privacy concerns and how Google is using the data they track and store about people who use their search service, he said:<br /><br />"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place." Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our wizard. (<a href="http://gawker.com/5419271/google-ceo-secrets-are-for-filthy-people">You can watch the video here</a>.)<br /><br />Remember, Eric Schmidt is not a bad man...he's just a very bad wizard.

        How do you find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle? If you have any recollection of this being hammered into your head year after year during grade school, you know that you square each of the other two sides, add the numbers together, and then take the square root. a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup><br /><br />This is a problem that has a convergent solution. You have a classroom full of 30 kids, and if you've done your job correctly, all 30 of them should be able to use the formula above to figure out that if a=3, and b=4, then c=5. <br /><br />I actually hated a lot of the stuff that teachers made me read in high school. The literature we had to read was supposed to give us perspective on the world, on the human condition, and actually make us feel the value in expressing ourselves through writing.<br /><br />One problem with this is that a lot of books that are good at doing this are banned from the public school system. But censorship is not the issue I want to talk about.<br /><br />The problem was the aim of the teachers. Reading and interpreting literature should <em>never</em> be treated like the hypotenuse example above. It's all too possible (and very likely) that all 30 of the kids you force to read some book they didn't ask to read will arrive at 30 different conclusions. It's a <em>divergent</em> exercise.<br /><br />Classroom discussions were often lectures by the teacher, instructing us what the author "meant" by analyzing themes, character motives, and plotlines so that all the students in the room would "learn" how to arrive at the correct interpretation of the book. <br /><br />If the point is not to be moved in a unique way by the prose, or to glean insight or inspiration from the small things, then why <em>not</em> just read the Cliff Notes? <br /><br />If an English teacher wants to grade me, mark me down on my correct use of grammer or spelling errors, but don't give me a lower grade because I didn't reach the same conclusion about <em>The Great Gatsby</em> as you.
