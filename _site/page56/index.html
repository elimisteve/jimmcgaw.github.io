                      As soon as a new avenue of media opens up, there's inevitably a bunch of critics that want to get rid of it or control it in some way. Usually, the debate heats up over time, and as more pressure is applied, a compromised is reached.Cinema emerged in the 1920s, and about 40 years later, the MPAA established its ratings system of G, PG, PG-13, and so forth, so that viewers could know beforehand whether...

                      There's a lady who plays the harp on the street in the town where I live. She's really quite good. She uses an amplifier to make the sound of the instrument carry quite a distance; you can hear her playing almost a full city block away. She's really quite good; people stop to listen to her play.

                      If so, your days are numbered.Time was, only so many books could be published per year. Each one had to be printed and distributed to bookstores, so as a publisher, there was a cap on how many you could produce each year. So, the name of the game became being very selective. If you publish a book, you better be reasonably sure it will sell well. It gave them license to discriminate.Now we can keep...

                      Here's an idea: pick a topic that interests you (preferably one you're familiar with), find a venue that will let you stand up for free, and then offer to speak on that topic for free. Post fliers, or find local organizations that are willing to tell their members about you because what you're talking about is relevant to what they do. You don't have to do a lot. Just spend an hour or so making...

                      In the movie The Wizard of Oz, I remember how strange and giddy the inside of the Emerald City was, when the singing quartet Dorothy and company finally arrive to see the wizard. After a bunch of silliness at the front door, they get inside and are greeted by throngs of singing people all dressed in green, an arena full of marvels, horses that change colors, and spa treatments. It's all brightly colored, shiny, and...

                      How do you find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle? If you have any recollection of this being hammered into your head year after year during grade school, you know that you square each of the other two sides, add the numbers together, and then take the square root. a2 + b2 = c2This is a problem that has a convergent solution. You have a classroom full of 30 kids, and if...
