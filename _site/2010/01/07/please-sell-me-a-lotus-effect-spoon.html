  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    A German engineering company developed a spoon, to which even the most viscous liquids will not stick. You can dip it into honey, and they honey will roll right off without leaving a trace. The actual composition of the surface of the spoon is based on the properties of the leaves of the lotus flower. Even liquids like glue will roll right off the surface of the leaf.<br/><br/>Here's the company website, as well as a couple picture demonstrating the "Lotus effect" in action: <a href="http://www.lotus-effekt.de/en/funktion/fluessig.php">Lotus Effect spoon pictures</a>.<br/><br/>From their FAQ page, here is one question, which also happens to be the exact question that led me to their website in the first place:<br/><br/>"Where is the Lotus-Effect® spoon available for sale?"<br/><br/>To which they politely reply:<br/><br/>"For demonstrations we employ a spoon with a perfect Lotus-Effect® surface. Honey and many other substances roll off without a hint of residue. The spoon is a prototype that is, unfortunately, not for sale."<br/><br/>Okay, let me see if I understand this correctly: your company is in possession of a patented technology, you developed a product with it, one of your frequently asked questions is <em>where can I buy that product</em>, and you refuse to mass produce it and sell it to people?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not supposed to understand.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I don't know what their long-term strategy is as a company, but it makes little sense to me that they would keep this kind of thing cooped up and hidden behind the legal red tape of patents and registered trademarks, especially if there's visible demand for it.<br/><br/>The company has applied the technology to cans of paint for use in the exteriors of buildings and that they're trying to sell it to builders who are interested in keeping moisture and dirt from creeping into their building materials. The so-called "Lotusan paint" is also not something you can just stroll into Home Depot and buy.<br/><br/>I see why they're guarding the whole "secret" so carefully, but it makes very little sense to keep this kind of technology proprietary. Instead of taking the time, effort, and imagination to brand itself well, they're just taking tiny, timid steps to introduce the product and keeping their competitive edge with the patents.<br/><br/>I think it's a losing strategy. If I were in their position, here's two things I would do:<br/><br/>1. Produce a bunch of Lotus-Effect spoons and give them away to people. Put the name of the company and the website on it. People will love the spoon and they'll show their friends. It will generate interest in the product.<br/><br/>2. License the technology behind the paint to one (or maybe even a few) of the major paint manufacturers and let them figure out how to market it to people who want to paint the outside of their houses with it. They already know how to distribute it, so there's no need to reinvent the wheel. When it takes off and becomes mainstream, everyone makes money. The challenge lies in getting enough produced to meet demand.<br/><br/>At the very least, start selling the spoons. I'm trying to imagine a crazy, mixed-up world where OXO has a prototype for a new, revolutionary new can opener and there's an FAQ on their site: "Where can I buy that fancy new can opener?"<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, OXO doesn't want to sell you that. Take your money and piss off."
