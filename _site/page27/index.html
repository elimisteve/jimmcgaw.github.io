        If there's one thing I've learned in life, creativity is not based on your level of intelligence, but rather on how you choose to inspire yourself. I've had long stretches of months where I was determined to be creative on my own, without any inspiration, because I felt that using any input would be cheating. If I sought out any ideas from other people, that would be cheating, and I'd never be able to claim the seed of my own creative output was entirely my own.<br /><br />To be clear, I'm not talking about stealing other people's ideas...at least not directly.<br /><br />That means it's important not only how much knowledge you possess, but also counts that you pick a good muse. Find someone who expresses themselves in a way that resonates with you, that you can respect, and that gives you the ability to express and develop your own ideas. There are insights in business books, in the speeches of motivational speakers, in ancient philosophical works, and even in reality television. The medium doesn't matter. A lot of them are saying the same basic things, and conveying the same basic ideas...they're just saying it different ways.<br /><br />Intelligence is more about being able to express yourself in a way so that others understand what you're trying to communicate to them. It's about being able to <em>articulate</em> what you know. This means that we ought to focus less of our energy on cramming our heads full of more facts and more knowledge. That's certainly important, because it often gives you insight of which you weren't aware and, in turn, can lead to more ideation and generate more awareness. But what we're often looking for is someone to help us express ourselves. We're looking to be empowered by what others say, because they're helping us find the words.<br /><br />Eventually, you'll find your own words. Flattery aside, imitation is about the only starting point most of us have.

        Has anyone else sensed that something about a college degree has changed fundamentally in the last 30 years?<br /><br />People in my parent's generation were in college and decided to attain a degree in liberal arts, with the knowledge that they'd (probably) struggle the rest of their lives to find steady work. Majoring in philosophy has always been pretty speculative.<br /><br />That's not what I'm talking about. The more certain degrees, like engineering, business, or anything else your parents might have encouraged (pushed) you to study, don't seem to offer as much security as they used to. More importantly, the rise in the cost of tuition has outpaced the rise in wages.<br /><br />A lot of students are opting not to go to college, either at all, or they're waiting, opting not to go immediately after graduating from high school. Me, I think all the people making this choice have a point.<br /><br />I wasn't interested in going to college right away. My father gently urged me to do so, because he felt I'd be better off in the long run. In hindsight, he was probably correct, but he did spend tens of thousands of dollars for me to get a degree that I'm not currently using. (At least, not in any direct way...I'm sure the education I received opened other doors for me.)<br /><br />The face of the retail world has changed significantly in the past few decades as well. Look at stores like Sears or Macy's...what if I led you blindfolded into the men's clothing department, took off the blindfold, and asked you to tell me which store we were standing in. Eventually, you'd be able to determine which one...but ignoring any signs reading "Sears" on them, how long would it take you?<br /><br />The race to the center of the bell curve has led to a kind of bland homogeneity. People aren't looking for middle-priced goods of middle quality. What they want instead is to shop at Wal-Mart (super cheap) or small specialty boutique shops (super special). People want stuff to cost very little. And what they are willing to pay for what feels like an exclusive experience. K-mart offers neither...and that's why they're in bankruptcy.<br /><br />Mediocrity has no place in the retail world. Sears isn't very cheap, and the stuff they sell is mass-produced. Why bother?<br /><br />The bulk of higher education seems to have raced quickly into the same space that K-mart and Sears occupy. Some companies are able to establish value and then scale up (Starbucks). But people are not products, so it's immensely difficult for a university to establish value and then scale up quickly. But most universities haven't been cautious. On the contrary, they've scaled up with reckless abandon, trying to get as many students into their doors and then back out again. They've become mass marketing machines. Which means more and more students with a standardized education are entering the labor market. In an era of commoditized applicants, it's no wonder employers are not rushing to pay more.<br /><br />You'd think college students would get some kind of volume discount. Nope...tuition costs are on the rise.<br /><br />My thinking: if you're looking to get a degree, is to go for an uber-cheap degree to avoid going into insurmountable debt, or, if you can do it, get into a really prestigious school. If you're going to get an MBA, get the best in-state deal you can at a local community college, or go to a great school like the Ross School of Business. Do either "cheap" or "special", but avoid the middle, where colleges seem to be in a race to be like one another.<br /><br />Or, if all else fails...<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41566021@N00/17296894/">try Harvard</a>.

        I was in Las Vegas last summer for a friend's bachelor party. We stayed in a hotel that was fairly new; it had just opened up a few month's prior to our stay. There were a lot of very cutting edge features in our hotel room.<br /><br />Light switches have always represented an interesting design challenge. If you have a bank of light switches in your home or office, chances are good it took you a little while to figure out which one mapped to which. There's simply no conceivable way of creating a light switch panel where the light each switch controls is self-evident. It always requires a learning curve.<br /><br />There were more than light switches in our room; switches controlled a fair number of things. I went to open the curtains on our window, and discovered they were motorized. There was no switch anywhere on the wall near the windows. After looking for it for a while, I gave up. Later, my very, very drunk roommate (who could barely stand) was fumbling to turn out the lights using the buttons above the nightstand. The curtains opened up.<br /><br />The next day, I was examining the bottled water and bags of nuts they put in your room, and they'll charge you if they disappear. I went to pick one up and my roommate (whose credit card bill was on file) freaked out on me. Apparently, they're seated on top of a weight sensor, and if anything is removed from the sensor, you get charged for the item...even if you put it back later. (They have to explain this to every guest that checks in.)<br /><br />Our first morning there, we spent about 10 minutes looking for the "Do Not Disturb" tag to hang on the door. Not finding it, we gave up and left for the day. While we were out, I got to thinking that it would make way more sense to build a "Do Not Disturb" tag right into the door, instead of deal with a hang tag. When we returned that afternoon, sure enough, there was a small, unmarked panel next to the door to our hotel room. It wasn't immediately clear what it did, but with the push of the right button, a small "DND" light came on outside our room.<br /><br />There's a large chasm between functional design and usability of new technology, and the average user who is supposed to figure out how it works. I'm not sure why the bridge across that chasm is so flimsy, because you'd expect these things to be tested before they're released into the wild. At least it makes for great comedy.

        When was the last time you changed your mind about something significant?<br /><br />Take a moment to think about it, because the answer isn't quite as straightforward as it might seem. We like to think that we're rational creatures who change our minds when we're presented with better information or facts. But this ignores the fact that we're human, and that we have ego issues. <br /><br />I can remember the last few times I changed my mind about something very significant, and there's one element common to all of them: I was listened to.<br /><br />Someone asked me my opinion about something, and they let me spew it out at them, without interrupting, and without any judgment. The second part is important, because when we sense we're being judged, we get defensive, and the problem with defense is that it's static. To make an unbudging mountain of a man, tell him he's wrong.<br /><br />But when we talk things through to others who listen to our story, and occasionally drop a well-placed, thoughtful question, we're actually pretty capable of talking ourselves out of our own beliefs. Maybe not immediately, but it can get the ball rolling in the right direction.<br /><br />And so, I listen, because people need that to arrive at their own truths. Usually, I don't perceive see this as an inconvenience...last time I checked, I don't have all the answers anyway.

        I don't lend out or give books to people very often. Not because I'm stingy when it comes to my book collection; I often take books that I'm done with and leave them on benches in public places. Interestingly, in my town, this is a common practice: when people are finished reading a book, they leave it in public for someone else to pick up and read it, and then return it to the benches when they're done. It's like a street library with no late fees. (but fairly poor selection.)<br /><br />I do that out of respect for other people's time and attention. I'd actually give away most of my books to anyone who expressed in reading one of them, just because I'm a big fan of passing the ideas forward. But if you give someone a book to read, there's a chance it will put pressure on them to read it. And asking someone to read a book is asking a very large time commitment from them.<br /><br />I use books in a very different way than most people, and part of that might be because I don't value my own time very much. I read lots of negative reviews on Amazon for books, and very frequently the reviewer says something like, "The author of this terrible book owes me the five hours I spent reading it." They feel frustrated that they sunk time into reading a book they didn't enjoy. In other cases, negative reviews are clearly coming from readers who had different expectations of the book before they started reading it. <br /><br />For me, I almost never perceive reading a book as a waste of time. I can't remember the last time I read a book and didn't get something out of it. Almost every book contains at least one idea that I can use, or I end up learning a handful of vocabulary words that I wasn't familiar with before. And I've never evaluated the effectiveness of a book based on how it met my expectations going into it; instead, I evaluate it based on how different of a person I am after having read it. If I learned something, if I'm entertained, if it changed my way of thinking in a way that I had hoped for, then I deem it a success.

        Do you know what a falling raindrop looks like? A lot of people think it looks like a sphere with a pointed top, but in reality, droplets of water only look like that when they're dangling off of something or sliding down a vertical surface. In mid-air, drops of water become completely spherical. That doesn't make sense to us, because it's not the way we see things.<br /><br />There's a small problem with the moment we're stuck in at any given point in time: we have a lot of trouble seeing it for what it is. It's difficult for us to assess the present because, at any given time, we tend to be caught up in dealing with what's at hand.<br /><br />And yet, if we can't clearly see where we are now, we tend to have a difficult time seeing exactly where we're headed.

        Yesterday, a newly elected Arizona representative was shot in Tucson by a 22-year-old shooter. The shooter killed 6 people and injured a dozen more. As the shooter fled the scene after killing and injuring several people, he was tackled to the ground by a bystander.<br /><br />A man with a gun puts bullets into 18 people, then runs away. If you saw that, what would you do?<br /><br />They've done studies about this, and apparently, only a small portion of people would tackle the shooter. It's very low...around 2%. Fortunately, I've never been in that situation, so I don't know how I'd react. Most of us don't know for sure what we'd do, because you can't know unless you've faced that particular scenario.<br /><br />In the face of danger, most of us freeze. Instinctually, that's what our limbic systems have evolved to do. We cease all movement, and hope the danger passes. We only resort to flight or fight if that doesn't work.<br /><br />I've been told that in some respects, I'm more of a risk taker than other people, particularly in terms of career. Considering that I got an accounting degree and am now working as a programmer, I don't completely agree with this opinion.<br /><br />What I do think, though, is that we are each willing to take risks in different respects, and we have different levels of tolerance we can stand for each one. Me, I got an accounting degree because I thought that the safest thing to do was to pick a steady career, work at a steady pace for many years, and retire to live off of savings.<br /><br />Given the economy of the past five years, I'm no longer convinced this is the wisest course of action. Does it make sense to stay at the same job for a couple of decades? Does it make sense to take a job at a very large company? Do we just find somewhere to fit in, keep still, and hope no one sees us?<br /><br />Does this sound safe to you?<br /><br />Life isn't quite as dramatic as it is on television, but time to time, we all see the waters start to churn in our own lives. Threats rear their ugly heads, and we try to combat them by becoming their opposite. Maybe if we hold still, they'll pass us by and we can live another day. I think, in the face of chaos, that more of us should be embracing it, and learning to live life on life's terms, because turbulence is inevitable.<br /><br />Freeze!

        My friend Dave shared <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2009/10/29/self-handicapping/">a link</a> yesterday, to an article that knowingly suggests that most of us set ourselves up for failure.<br /><br />When I was in college, I became acquainted with a lot of very different, very smart people. Even on a larger campus, you start to run into the same faces over and over again. I met lots of people with novels to write, albums to compose, and other things to give. They would offer share their ideas with me in great detail.<br /><br />Later, I would try and make a point of following up. If I ran into them again, I'd ask how things were going with them. Almost always, there had been no follow through on their part.<br /><br />There's no judgment on my part. Honestly, people do what they do, and many people have different priorities. I learned lots from socializing in college, but one very important lesson: <em>the difference between a writer and a non-writer is that a writer writes</em>. Talent, skill, style...those things matter, but in the old adage about practice making perfect, the order matters. And many people believe, incorrectly, that meditating on an idea will beget perfection, after which point they can get started practicing.<br /><br />This year, I want to learn how to sketch with pencil. I'm bad at it. The biggest obstacle is picking up the damned sketch pad, because I know before I even start that the result will be terrible.<br /><br />But I won't let that stop me.

        In Cambodia, deep in the jungle, lies the ancient temple of Angkor Wat. Inside, there is a large stone carving on a tablet called the "Churning Ocean of Milk", which features many gods and demons in a battle of tug of war with a large snake suspended over an ocean of milk.<br /><br />In this story, the battle rages endlessly between both sides, and the endgame has nothing to do with either side winning...it has to do with the struggle itself. The snake churns the milk, which would otherwise turn sour.<br /><br />Republicans and Democrats will never completely agree with one another. If we follow the track record of history, the arguments over religion show little signs of vanishing anytime soon. Maybe it's not about either side being right, but about the benefits of the debate itself. Put another way: harmony is stagnation.

        Do you have a soap problem in your house? Is your bathroom missing hand soap, or is anti-bacterial cleaner missing from your kitchen?<br /><br />Chances are pretty good, if you live in the United States, that it isn't. Advertisers spent the last century working to make sure that most Americans have their soap and cleaning supply problem taken care of. Fortunately for hygiene and health, they've largely succeeded...almost no one is in search of a new cleaning product. The ones we already have work well enough.<br /><br />There were a couple of guys who didn't think this was true. And they did something about it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.methodhome.com/shop">Method</a> is on a mission to redesign soap. It wasn't broken to begin with, but they decided to fix it, and lots of people have decided they agree with them enough to buy their products. If you've ever seen the rack of Method brand soaps on display on the shelf at Target, then you have a sense of why: their choice of colors and bottle shapes, all put together, are very visually striking.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.oxo.com/s-21-good-grips.aspx">Oxo</a> did this ten years ago with kitchen utensils. No one was busy looking for a better onion peeler, but Oxo created one, and an ostentatious one, at that. People browsing merchandise in Sur La Table went for it.<br /><br />It's not the only reason, but the successes of these companies was aided in very, very large part by the design of the products. Sometimes the success is in spite of the design...think of Herman Miller's Aeron chair, which looks like a giant arthropod. But they happened not just because someone decided to build a better mousetrap, but because they insisted that the mousetrap should <em>look good</em> at the same time.<br /><br />Speaking of which, as far as I know, no one's tried to build a more elegant mousetrap in the last ten years. That goes for a lot of household products. What are you keeping under your sinks and televisions that could be re-designed in some way?
