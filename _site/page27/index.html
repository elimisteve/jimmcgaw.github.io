                      If there's one thing I've learned in life, creativity is not based on your level of intelligence, but rather on how you choose to inspire yourself. I've had long stretches of months where I was determined to be creative on my own, without any inspiration, because I felt that using any input would be cheating. If I sought out any ideas from other people, that would be cheating, and I'd never be able to claim...

                      Has anyone else sensed that something about a college degree has changed fundamentally in the last 30 years?People in my parent's generation were in college and decided to attain a degree in liberal arts, with the knowledge that they'd (probably) struggle the rest of their lives to find steady work. Majoring in philosophy has always been pretty speculative.That's not what I'm talking about. The more certain degrees, like engineering, business, or anything else your parents...

                      I was in Las Vegas last summer for a friend's bachelor party. We stayed in a hotel that was fairly new; it had just opened up a few month's prior to our stay. There were a lot of very cutting edge features in our hotel room.Light switches have always represented an interesting design challenge.

                      When was the last time you changed your mind about something significant?Take a moment to think about it, because the answer isn't quite as straightforward as it might seem. We like to think that we're rational creatures who change our minds when we're presented with better information or facts. But this ignores the fact that we're human, and that we have ego issues. I can remember the last few times I changed my mind about...

                      I don't lend out or give books to people very often. Not because I'm stingy when it comes to my book collection; I often take books that I'm done with and leave them on benches in public places. Interestingly, in my town, this is a common practice: when people are finished reading a book, they leave it in public for someone else to pick up and read it, and then return it to the benches...

                      Do you know what a falling raindrop looks like? A lot of people think it looks like a sphere with a pointed top, but in reality, droplets of water only look like that when they're dangling off of something or sliding down a vertical surface. In mid-air, drops of water become completely spherical. That doesn't make sense to us, because it's not the way we see things.There's a small problem with the moment we're stuck...

                      Yesterday, a newly elected Arizona representative was shot in Tucson by a 22-year-old shooter. The shooter killed 6 people and injured a dozen more. As the shooter fled the scene after killing and injuring several people, he was tackled to the ground by a bystander.A man with a gun puts bullets into 18 people, then runs away. If you saw that, what would you do?They've done studies about this, and apparently, only a small portion...

                      My friend Dave shared a link yesterday, to an article that knowingly suggests that most of us set ourselves up for failure.When I was in college, I became acquainted with a lot of very different, very smart people.

                      In Cambodia, deep in the jungle, lies the ancient temple of Angkor Wat. Inside, there is a large stone carving on a tablet called the "Churning Ocean of Milk", which features many gods and demons in a battle of tug of war with a large snake suspended over an ocean of milk.In this story, the battle rages endlessly between both sides, and the endgame has nothing to do with either side winning...it has to do...

                      Do you have a soap problem in your house? Is your bathroom missing hand soap, or is anti-bacterial cleaner missing from your kitchen?Chances are pretty good, if you live in the United States, that it isn't.
