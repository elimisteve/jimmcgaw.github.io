        If you were to stick me on a pulpit in front of a multitude of kids in high school and let me speak to them for a couple of minutes, here's roughly what I would say:<br /><br />I'd like to talk about the one aspect of adulthood that affects just about everyone: employment. As much as you might dislike a lot of the work you're doing in your classes now, you're all smart enough to know that growing into adulthood doesn't offer a magical cure for this.<br /><br />A handful of you, for one reason or another, will never have to work. You'll be financially independent and thus exempt from this privilege. Choose to work anyway. Cultivate a skill, and use it to help others do what they are unable to do for themselves.<br /><br />Some of you will be fortunate enough to find paths that will afford you mobility. You'll be able to be selective about which jobs you accept and which ones you turn down. Invest the time early on in your life to distinguish which types of jobs you find meaningful from those you don't, and gravitate towards those in which you find meaning.<br /><br />And to those of you who end up finding yourselves in jobs that you wouldn't choose or that you actively dislike: find meaning in the work anyway. Whatever it takes, whatever you have to do, find meaning in your efforts. If, for any reason, you can't do this, find another job. However insignificant your job might be, however pointless it might feel to you at times, <i>never</i> stop seeking to understand that what you are doing matters.

      <div class="content">
        In middle school, I had a friend who absolutely hated the popular culture in the United States and the members of his own generation that had embraced it. In particular, he focused on the effect of music. This was in the middle of the 1990's, shortly after Kurt Cobain had decided to recuse his spirit from our world. He felt that the 1960's had been the ideal decade for our country, when the Beatles reigned supreme among the British invaders, and popular culture seemed to dedicate itself to a message of peace.<br /><br />He came from a religious household, and, to a certainty, he was predisposed to adopting the mindset of his parents without considering it carefully for himself. I'm sure this played a part in how he formed his opinions. In hindsight, knowing more about history, I'm a little confused as to why he settled on the 1960's, the decade that gave birth to the Sexual Revolution, as the epoch that represents America's bastion of morality.<br /><br />This was my friend's rallying cry, from his favorite musician: "I just wasn't made for these times." He felt this adequately expressed his own sense of alienation from his peers and the world around him. I guess it was completely lost on him that Brian Wilson, with whom he identified, wrote those lyrics during the very era my friend was idealizing.<br /><br />I've since learned that my friend is far from alone. Sure, not everyone does this for religious reasons, not everyone is so focused on music and how its content affects culture, and not everyone lands on the 1960's...but I've met plenty of people who, for a wide variety of reasons, romanticize some era of the past. They decry what the world has devolved into, and long for a massive, collective return to the some extinct period.<br /><br />Why do people do this?<br /><br />For me, this is an interesting thought experiment. I don't know much about history, but when I last studied the subject in high school, it was presented to me as a dry collection of facts, a chronological sequence of events and dates we had to memorize. Abraham Lincoln managed to free the slaves in our country. I learned that much. But I didn't learn until much later that this happened amidst a political hotbed of conflict that, in many ways, rivaled that of our present day. The country was divided over an important social issue that people argued with each other about, so much so that civil war broke out.<br /><br />So I wonder: what was it really like to live, as a normal citizen, during this era? What kind of lifestyle did the average Yankee embrace? What was their quality of life like? In the days preceding the Civil War, where did their discussions about this divisive issue take place, and what did those discussions sound like? How many of them actually cared about the conflict, and how much did they care, when war broke out? What did they eat? And so on.<br /><br />I hope it's obvious that I don't romanticize this era; I'm grateful to live in a time where I don't have to argue with my friends and neighbors about the ethics of keeping another human being as a slave. I'm just using this as a example of the difficulty of grasping a true understanding of the distant past. I could certainly read books about any particular time in the past and get a better sense, but I think I'd encounter plenty of downsides to living in this era as well. Certainly enough that I'd come to appreciate the era in which I <i>do </i>live. But I'm sure there are also ways in which our present compares unfavorably with some aspects of the past.<br /><br />I think people like to latch onto the past as a lost ideal because, like my friend from middle school, they have difficulty connecting with the world that they inhabit. They struggle to find their place, to attain a sense of belonging, to identify with the people around them. You can't point at the world around you and claim that there's something wrong with it unless you have something you can compare it to. If not there here and now, then where and when? We live in an age where enough is documented about modern history that it's relatively easy to pick a particular past era you favor and use that as a basis for comparison.<br /><br />Naturally, if you pose the hypothetical question: what if you could be transported back and live in during the time period you romanticize? If this were actually possible, I think most of these people would concede that, while the past was great, our present is pretty swell, and it's where our friends and family reside, so you have to take the bad with the good. And they'd easily recognize that this wouldn't solve their biggest problem: even if you lived in the past, you'd still struggle to find your place in it. So these people are more preoccupied with the fantasy of transforming some aspects of our present to be more like the past.<br /><br />This begs the question: if you could actually morph the present into what you want it to be, would this solve the problem of finding your place in our present? Are you really feeling lost because the world has changed so much from what it once was, or are you just feeling lost because that's the way all human beings feel sometimes, regardless of the world in which they live?<br /><br />For my part, I love the world that I live in. It's not perfect. There are things about it I might like to change, and we certainly have a wealth of documented information about the past from which to draw inspiration and ideas. But I don't <i>hate</i>&nbsp;the world and the era in which I live. If I wish to change some parts of it, I recognize that dismissing the world as it currently exists is actually counterproductive. If you would change the world, you must start with an understanding of&nbsp;<i>where it is now</i>, and move it slowly forward based on this understanding. You accomplish nothing for the world, and little for yourself, by sticking your head in the sand and trying to wish the past back to life. Let the dead attempt to resuscitate their own dead.<br /><br />At the same time, it is through these people that the past stays alive in our present. I'm not going to go become a Quaker, but I don't think it's terrible that they've chosen this lifestyle for themselves. My ideal world isn't one in which all young people embrace Meghan Trainor because she's at the top of the Billboard charts; sometimes we need people who will dust off their old Beach Boys CDs, pop them into a player, and let 'er rip. We all have those moments; when the present feels like the cruise on the Sloop John B, sometimes you just long to go home.

      <h1><a href="/2016/04/02/autism-and-the-human-spectrum.html">Autism and the Human Spectrum</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">

      <div class="content">
        I learned earlier this week that today is Autism Awareness Day. This means that today, among other things, we're all encouraged to wear blue. Several global landmarks will be lit up by blue lighting.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I traveled around the country to various cities to attend startup competitions. I wanted to get a sense of how the entrepreneurial culture varied from city to city around the United States, meet like-minded programmers and get perspectives on tech culture from the boots on the ground, and see cities that I had never seen before.<br /><br />The trips served these goals admirably, but I had another agenda: I wanted to get myself interacting with as many strangers in strange places as I possibly could. I was looking for perspective not only on the world around me, but on <i>myself</i>.<br /><br />At the time, I had started to recognize that I was meeting with a fair amount of rejection in large social situations. I had no way of discerning if there was a problem with this, and, if there was, just how much of it was attributable to me versus other factors. It wasn't that&nbsp;<i>everyone</i>&nbsp;rejected me. Some amount of rejection is normal. How much? Was I just paying more attention to the few people who were rejecting me than the people who were engaging with me and accepting me?<br /><br />In hindsight, I think I was just being a little too sensitive to rejection, and in my head, it was pervading all my other social interactions. At the time, I was confused about this, so I immediately started to assume it had something to do with me. This bias compounds itself: you think there's something wrong with you, so as you interact with people, they sense that you think that about yourself, and you get rejected more. Suffice it to say, my travels around the country did little to ease my concerns about this. As the fellow said: fear itself.<br /><br />It's difficult to search around online for information about this sort of thing, for one simple reason: <i>it's difficult to truly know what's going on inside of your own head</i>. The Internet requires that you have keywords or phrases in order to find something; vague notions about your own inner mental workings are insufficient input to get adequate or helpful search results.<br /><br />I settled on the hypothesis that I might be someplace on the autistic spectrum. I have a natural propensity for computer programming, the prior year I had spent much of my own time studying quantum mechanics <i>for fun</i>, and ostensibly, social interactions felt like a problem for me. It wasn't the best theory, but you need to have <i>something</i>&nbsp;to take to a psychologist when you go and ask them for help.<br /><br />Long story short, I eventually went to see someone who specialized in dealing with autistic spectrum disorders, and they reassured me, with complete confidence, that this was definitely not my problem. I was capable of carrying on a conversation, maintaining eye contact, etc. I remember feeling relieved by this; perhaps I was socially inept, but it was only because I had never really learned, not because I was incapable.<br /><br />Now, I need to be absolutely clear about what I'm about to say. I have <i>no idea</i>&nbsp;what it is like to be autistic. I have never had a family member or friend who suffered from this that I've had to support emotionally. But the truth is, I did spend a few months of my life in this darkness, thinking that perhaps there was something "wrong" with me, thinking that connecting with other people would be a struggle for me for the rest of my life, simply because I had been born with some kind of illness that would preclude me from functioning the way society expects you to.<br /><br />In the end, this darkness was completely self-imposed by me. I can see that now. So I'm not trying to say that, because of this experience, that I can properly empathize with anyone who is struggling with autism. What this afforded me, after the fact, was <i>perspective</i>. I wrote a few years ago about a <a href="/2010/03/03/lessons-from-schizophrenic.html">schizophrenic neighbor</a> that I had for a time. I learned from that experience. In addition to understanding the importance of having compassion for people who suffer from these kinds of things, I concluded that we ourselves shouldn't take it for granted that we have been spared this suffering in our own lives.<br /><br />I emerged from this dark time in my life to overhear conversations people were having about how much they didn't like one grocery store versus another, complaints about dealing with traffic, and so on, and suddenly these words passed in and out of my head like white noise. For a time, there were periods where it was difficult to focus on what I was doing at work.<br /><br />Here's the thing about autism: we can't discern the cause, the afflictions themselves are arbitrary. This scares people. Why do people persist in believing that vaccines cause autism when there's <i>absolutely no scientific evidence to back this up?</i>&nbsp;My best theory is that it's easier to distance yourself from the possibility of the problem if you have any cause to attribute it to that minimizes the fear that it can happen to you.<br /><br />A parent tells another person that they have an autistic child. The person asks the parent if they've vaccinated their child, to which any partway responsible parent would answer, "Of course I did." Aha! Then it's the parent's fault! If it's something that the parent did, then it's something that can be controlled. If I can avoid doing the thing that caused it, if I give myself the illusion of having control, then the world becomes a little less terrifying.<br /><br />That last statement, of course, contains one pernicious assumption that must be called out: that having an autistic child is something that should be feared. I remember having a discussion about the possibility of having children with someone once. They gave me this admonition: "If you have a child, you have to consider the possibility that it might be born with Down's syndrome or some other disease."<br /><br />This rendered me speechless. If you have a child, aren't you going to love it unconditionally, no matter what problems it might have? You don't decide to become a parent and hope that you get a perfect, flawless child. Such a child has never existed anyway, and who are any of us to think that our lives should just be easy?<br /><br />As much as this hearing this comment from someone horrified me, internally I was thinking back to my early twenties. At the time, I gave a lot of thought to having children, and one thing that terrified me was that this very same thought had crossed my mind. <i>What if they're born with a defect? The child will have been brought into this world, by me, with a struggle ahead of them, and that's my fault, right?</i>&nbsp;This is immature thinking at best. Anyone who thinks this way probably shouldn't choose to become a parent right away without some serious soul-searching. I possessed enough self-awareness to recognize that, since I felt this way on some level, I should probably steer clear of having children.<br /><br />I'm still ambivalent about whether or not I'll ever decide to have children; it's certainly not the most pressing priority in my life. But now, in my early thirties, I have given it some thought lately, and I've come to realize that if I were to adopt or have a child, I would love it <i>no matter what</i>. It wouldn't matter to me what the child is afflicted with; I would love it all the same, and support it however it needs to be supported. I'm absolutely sure of this now, in a way that I could never have claimed to be in my youth. I still haven't figured out why or how I've come to this change of heart, but it makes me happy to recognize that perhaps, in the last decade, I've matured a little.<br /><br />I'm grateful that my life has been so sparsely populated with suffering, and what little suffering I've encountered has been relatively easy to bear. I've been lucky. But good luck can also stunt our personal growth. Perhaps this is why suffering gets tossed into our lives. It invariably forces new perspective on us, in a way that nothing else can possibly achieve. It teaches us compassion. Suffering is the universal human variable; the constant should be our propensity and willingness to help one another overcome it.

        I received word from a former colleague yesterday that the company I just left about a month ago went through a round of layoffs. While this doesn't come as a complete surprise, that does little to lessen the emotional blow. I know that two people with whom I worked very closely for the past two years, people I greatly respect, got the axe.<br /><br />I decided to take my sabbatical for personal reasons, but I knew it was my time, and I had the resources to do it. I can't be sure how many people were let go. I suspect that many of the people who were let go were caught off guard, and I'm sure some of them have families to support. This is never easy.<br /><br />It was a company full of good people; having to leave the situation was bittersweet. My heart goes out to all of them. I sincerely hope that those who had to be let go find a way forward and land on their feet.

        I wrote a couple of months ago about my recent <a href="/2016/02/17/the-accidental-cyberstalker.html">terribly failed foray</a> back into the world of dating.

What matters more to me is how the events affected me in the larger context of my personal life at the time, and the fallout that trailed along after them. I have been reflecting carefully on the experience in order to distill what it might mean I need to change about myself. Working through the guilt of my mistake has been strangely <i>transformative</i>; and indeed, this <i>is</i> worth expounding on.<br /><br />I wrote the original blog post for a few reasons: first, I sent the link to the post to the girl in question, in the hopes of allaying any fears she might have had about me. When a man scares a woman on the Internet, well, I have no idea how you rectify that situation, outside of backing off. The way I saw it, this kind of fear is based on an imbalance of power. I figured that making a public disclosure of my side of the events, and admitting my part in it, was one small way to shift the balance of power back into her court. (Whether this worked or accomplished what I hoped it would, I have no way of knowing, but I didn't see how it could possibly hurt.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Second, I genuinely wanted to communicate the errors I had made in a blog post that could be read and consumed by others, so that perhaps other people would read it and operate with a little more foresight in a similar situation than I did. This is the reason I'm writing this blog post now. I sincerely hope that someone takes my mistakes and avoids repeating them. To this end, the original post also implied some points that are worth making explicit here.</div><div><br /></div><div>Lastly, writing not only helps me crystallize ideas that are fuzzy into concrete language, it also helps exorcise these things from my brain. If there's anything to be learned from all this, that's groovy, but I'm also ready to put this behind me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wrote the two blog entires linked above in the first paragraph in the throes of intense guilt, largely out of desperation to try and make sense of the events. Writing was my only possible outlet at the time. I admit they're not well-written, since my thoughts were reeling and clouded under all the stress. So, given the smattering of scattered thoughts in those blog entries, a person reading them might ask: what the hell actually happened?</div><div><br /></div><div>In cases like this, where I've done something wrong, I'm extremely wary of cognitive biases distorting my memory of events in my favor. I worry about omitting crucial details so I seem like less of a bad guy. I worry that I'm changing details to make myself feel better. Truly, I've combed through what happened very carefully, and this represents my own motives and what happened, with as little deceit as I can manage. It might read as justification for what I did; if it comes across that way, I don't intend it to, because I sincerely wish I could take all this back. All I can do is offer what I hope is an honest accounting of the events.</div><div><br /></div><div>My ex-girlfriend and I were together for 12 years, until last September. As sometimes happens, this ended, and I spent the next several months among friends, licking my own wounds and trying to imagine venturing back out into the world with any shred of confidence. This was incredibly hard to imagine doing in the early months; it was my first real significant breakup, ever.</div><div><br /></div><div>In January, I happened to notice a picture of a girl from my past in my Facebook news feed. I hadn't seen her in over a decade. This sparked an initial romantic interest on my part. For about a week, I was unable to let the thought go, so I started to think about how to proceed.</div><div><br /></div><div>In 9th grade, I remember developing a crush on a girl that lasted for months and, being 14 years old, I was terrified to approach her. When I finally did, she rejected me. I learned from this that we're not meant to sit on these kinds of things, holding them solely in our heads. If you have a romantic interest in someone, it makes the most sense to let the other person know, as soon as possible, and put the ball into their court. Rejection happens; you just move forward when it does.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, while the initial spark happened in an online social network, I'm old-fashioned. There's no way I'm going to try and strike up a romantic relationship with a girl via some online chat program or by phone. There's no way for two people to read each other's signals and truly determine if there's chemistry without some kind of <i>face-to-face</i>&nbsp;meeting. It made sense to me that if anything was going to happen in this situation, it should happen in person.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the time, nothing in my life was fixed for the long-term. I was interested in getting out of my current living situation, leaving the city when I was living, and leaving my current job. I was long overdue for moving on from the life I had shared with my ex, and in taking some initial steps to figure out what my life's work should be. On top of this, I hadn't spent any time with my parents since I gotten out of this past relationship, and both of them were slated to have minor surgeries surrounding the weekend of Valentine's Day.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, the timing of all this seemed to indicate that perhaps I <i>should</i>&nbsp;go back to Michigan to get closure on this romantic interest of mine. Maybe it wasn't crazy to go and figure out this situation, then determine how I should move forward in my life. But still: flying all the way across the country for the slim possibility of a relationship with a girl who doesn't even know me? Who I don't know? A girl who might not even want a relationship? Could that possibly be a good idea?</div><div><br /></div><div>I gave the idea a lot of thought, and to be perfectly honest, it seemed ridiculous to me. This isn't normal behavior. I considered that I hadn't been on a "first date" in over a decade, which made the notion of investing so much time and energy into this one particular prospect even more ridiculous. I never have been smooth with women, so without fail, I was bound to be rusty, bound to make some silly mistake. But on the other hand, I've spend most of my adult life in timidity; perhaps audacity was meant to have its day for a change.</div><div><br /></div><div>I meditated on this decision in one of my many hikes up into the foothills of Santa Barbara late one evening. I spent a lot of time considering this, and in the end, I concluded that it was important for me to at least explore the possibility. If I embarked on the journey, I was to go "to be judged". There would be important information revealed to me about myself in the process of this journey unfolding. I had no idea what to make of this odd concept that struck my brain, but I had little reason to ignore it. More practically, given my situation, I didn't think I had anything to lose. <i>Toujours l'audace</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I reached out to this girl on Facebook and asked her if she'd be interested in meeting with me if I were to come to Michigan. She responded that she would be game, and I asked her if she'd be free to meet "the second weekend in February"...the Sunday of which was the 14th. She replied that she would, which delighted me.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I later learned that my subtle hint about the holiday on that particular weekend was, alas, a little <i>too</i> subtle. Mid-last year, I had a fortune cookie tell me: "Be direct; one can usually accomplish more that way." I saved that slip of paper, since I felt it was a lesson I needed to learn. I wish I had listened to that cookie.</div><div><br /></div><div>I described myself as a "cyberstalker" in the original blog post; in fairness, this is a little too strong of a term for what I actually did. It was a word I found when Googling around the night after she told me never to contact her again, when I was genuinely scared that I had done something truly evil. I was trying to figure out what I had done wrong, to figure out if I had done anything wrong, and I found the term "cyberstalker" in an e-card. I knew that men often harass women on the Internet, but I didn't perceive any of my actions leading up to our meeting as having been <i>that</i> egregious. But I didn't want to let myself off the hook right away.</div><div><br /></div><div>When she agreed to a tentative meeting, here's what I did: I did some cursory scanning of her Facebook news feed (where we were friends), listened to some music on her playlists on Spotify (also friends, I think), browsed some of her retweets on Twitter (not following her), and browsed some of the books she was reading on Goodreads (where we were connected). I'm always looking for new book suggestions, and hers were unique, so I latched on to a few of them. We had a lot of overlapping interests in reading material anyway, so this wasn't too much of a stretch.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Again, I'm used to doing this kind of background research before you meet a potential business colleague for lunch. You're looking to establish common ground early in the conversation. If you're going to go meet a girl for the first time in the hopes of striking up a relationship with her, I'd recommend you don't do this.</div><div><br /></div><div>In hindsight, going all the way across with country with this as my primary objective wasn't fair to either of us. It put undue pressure on her, to be sure, but it also put undue pressure on me. I went into our rendezvous knowing that a lack of chemistry or rejection was <i>all but certain</i>, but still, when the moment came to bear my soul, I think my social anxiety went into overdrive. In any normal situation, I can be an intense person anyway...but when I told her I was interested in her romantically because I thought she was pretty, I'm reasonably sure it seemed like I was gushing.</div><div><br /></div><div>We didn't speak after that; subsequently, there was the communication breakdown that happened over text messages. I read the signals incorrectly: to my surprise, she expressed interest&nbsp;in having dinner, but there was hesitation. I assumed she was unsure of herself, so I tried to be cutesy-romantic and reassuring in response, only to discover that she wasn't unsure of herself...she was unsure of <i>me</i>. My attempts to fan the flames were actually throwing gasoline onto them, in the worst possible way.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the last thing she said to me, she mentioned that she was concerned that I had grown infatuated with an idealized conception of her, based on her online persona, and not the real her. Given the situation, that's a genuine concern, and if I'm guilty of overstepping any appropriate social boundaries, it might be that. It's very possible that my life had grown stale and, wanting to explore possible futures, I might have seen the possibility of some kind of future with her. Perhaps when I asked her for a date, I was asking that ideal version of her from my head, and not the actual her in reality, with whom I had just taken coffee for a couple hours.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first thing I did after returning to California in the wake of this whole experience was to quit my job. Many of my friends have asked if I'm planning to be a programmer again. I honestly haven't decided that yet. Not only do I doubt that I can contribute to the world the way I want to as a programmer, but I'm seriously wondering if I carried out this idiotic plan because I've spent the last decade of my life staring at a computer screen. Human beings aren't wired to do this; we're wired for empathy and for human connection, not to pound instructions and messages to online friends into little machines all day. Maybe this lifestyle was a contributing factor.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I mentioned, my <a href="/2016/02/17/the-accidental-cyberstalker.html">original blog post</a> was meant to shift the power dynamic of the situation, as a means of atonement. I have a couple of regrets about it: first, if you read it a certain way, and not the way I intended, it makes me out to be the victim in the situation. I was not the victim; it just seemed more important to be honest about my sense of guilt and vulnerability at the time than to save face. In that emotional state, I'm not sure I <i>could</i>&nbsp;have saved face.</div><div><br /></div><div>Second, it did a terrible job in the way of offering an apology. (I doubt she'll ever read this...but I'm not writing this for her.) Apologies are a difficult thing to get right, and most of us so rarely practice them in writing. So, here goes: I understand that when we met, I wasn't straightforward with you about the purpose of our meeting; I did nothing to establish trust before asking you to trust me. I understand that my behavior caused you fear; I don't feel that I can fully understand this fear, but I'm trying to appreciate it. I understand that I didn't treat you as the person you actually were, and instead treated you as a person that I thought you might be. This is insulting; this has been done to me in the past, and it's diminutive. If the situation had happened in reverse, I probably would have reacted to you just as you did to me. The way things played out was not my intent, and I'm sorry.</div><div><br /></div><div>I hate to draw anything good from what happened...but I've also been powerless to do anything else. For my part, when I make a mistake of this magnitude, I catastrophize. In the days immediately after all of this happened, I felt ashamed of what I had done. Like my brain is so good at doing, every single mistake I had ever made in every relationship I had ever had was paraded in front of me in my mind's eye. This is common: as the brain seeks to shame you for some mistake, it dredges up from memory, in ugly detail, every similar example in order to reinforce the shame.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps on some level, I knew this whole thing was a bad idea from the start, and this is why my brain manufactured the "to be judged" rationalization for the purpose of my journey: so that if things went wrong, I'd have some way of making sense of the whole experience. I can't say if this the case, but in either event, in the days immediately after this all took place, this is precisely what happened. As all my past mistakes emerged from my memory and stared me in the face, one by one, I was overcome with guilt for each of them, but I was also seeing them all plainly for the first time. I was seeing clearly my own personal history, warts and all. Unexpectedly, this afforded me <i>clarity</i>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As this became clear, the cloak of self-deception I had wrapped myself in fell away. It made me feel wonderfully <i>human</i>. A human being can make mistakes, learn from them, and move forward. Here's what I learned: I no longer feel the need to run from the demons of my past in the fear that they'll hold me captive; I embrace them because it's the only way to really set yourself free of their grasp. The way out is through.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'll make more mistakes in the future, I'm sure. I put a call to action for my readers at the end of my original blog post, along with expressing my own intention to do something to try and make this right; I truly believe that if you make a mistake like this, you've upset the karmic balance in the universe. To the extent that you can, do something to shift the karmic balance back in the right direction. (And even if you're not aware of any particular mistake you've made, it doesn't hurt to assume you have and send the world some karmic love anyhow.)</div><div><br /></div><div>For the time being, I've signed off of Facebook, and it's unlikely that I'll return anytime soon. Life is too exciting and beautiful without that kind of nonsense distracting us from it. It mires us in our pasts; the whole damned thing is a green light, in the <i>Gatsby</i>&nbsp;sense of the phrase.&nbsp;I really can't see myself ever pursuing a romantic interest that originated anywhere on the Internet ever again; I'm a little disappointed that I've re-emerged into the dating world in an era where something like Tinder is actually a common thing that people use...but <i>ob-la-di, ob-la-da</i>.&nbsp;In any case, I've decided not to pursue any more romantic interests for the time being, offline or otherwise...at least until I can figure out how to navigate this new world I've been out of for so long.</div><div><br /></div><div>In response to all this, a wise friend told me that I should just let life wash over me for a while, instead of rushing out to surf its waves; to let things come to me, instead of scrambling to find them. This feels like good advice. My eyes, head, and heart remain open. Come what may.</div>

        I often encounter the argument that, since the mechanisms that govern life within an individual living organism are so incredibly complex, and since the diversity of organism in our world is legion, that this must be evidence of the existence of a Creator.<br /><br />Conversely, others look at the mechanisms that led to the complexity and diversity of the world, and insist that all of it occurred randomly. They reach completely the opposite conclusion: a world that has come to be as it is so messily and haphazardly must be evidence that there is no Creator.<br /><br />The logic for either of these arguments is spurious. Nothing can be concluded from scientific knowledge about the existence of a Higher Power, either now or at the inception of our universe. If you approach science with one viewpoint or the other, you can probably find the "evidence" to back up either conclusion. As of yet, I haven't heard an argument either way that holds water...though I keep an open mind.<br /><br />Richard Feynman was adamant about describing the role of science in our world. He said that science is merely trying to <i>understand the rules</i>. The analogy he used was simple: imagine the entire observable universe is a large game of chess being played. We can watch the game in action, but we don't know the rules governing the actions of the players. So we watch, and after enough time, and enough moves, you begin to understand how each piece is allowed to move.<br /><br />This is the role of science: to derive the rules governing our universe from observation. Nothing can be concluded from the scientific investigation about why the game exists, why the rules are the way they are, or whether or not a grand Rulemaker exists.

        The conversation began with him offering an (unsolicited) political opinion to me: "The thing about Democrats / liberals is that they don't like the American way of life. They don't like the principles this country was founded upon, and they want to change our way of life, even though there isn't a better one anywhere else in the world."<br /><br />It ended with me replying: "You're obviously not a Democrat / liberal, so why would I let you or your opinions inform me on their worldview?"<br /><br />You could easily swap in Republican / conservative to the above (with some minor modifications), and the conversation has probably happened. I've made this point before, but it bears repeating: don't tell people who you aren't, and don't tell people what you don't believe. Tell people who you are, and what you believe, and then maybe they'll truly be able to connect with you.

        Just now, I was attempting to help my mother connect her computer to a wireless network. I'm a fairly technically savvy person; I'm a software engineer, and because I often take an intense interest in subjects that I don't need to, I have a pretty decent understanding of how 802.11 wireless networks function. (Though the low-level hardware in routers and wireless cards is completely alien to me.)<br /><br />Trying to help someone else do something this simple with their computer is always eye-opening. It's no secret among technologists that as soon as we attempt to help someone like this, we quickly learn just how massive a gulf still exists between laypeople and the usability of the experience of interacting with the technology. This is still true, even in an era where technology is both unavoidable as part of normal life, and where civilization is rife with gizmos that claim to have been designed for a high ease of use.<br /><br />When my computer won't connect to a wireless network, I know what steps I should take to troubleshoot. I turn the wireless card off and then back on. I restart the computer. I run diagnostics on the wireless card. Is it only your computer? If not, maybe the router needs a restart or the modem needs a power cycle. Sometimes you just have to walk away from the machine and come back a few hours later, when the gremlins have moved on.<br /><br />How do I know this? In this particular case, I've had this problem before, and I've spent time trying things through trial and error. &nbsp;In some cases I do Internet searches. But the point is: no one really taught me all of this. I had to derive which steps to try, and the order of their probably effectiveness, from my experience...but I take it for granted that I understand technology well enough to figure this kind of thing out.<br /><br />So when my mother's computer won't connect, she really has no idea what the first step should be. (My suggestion is to do a Google search, assuming you have some other access to the Internet, and assuming also that you are capable of understanding that advice in the articles you find. But both of these assumptions could be bad.)<br /><br />In walking her through the steps I know, at one point, she needed to enter her system password. First of all, it wasn't clear to her <i>which</i>&nbsp;password she needed to enter. But the main issue arose when she entered the wrong password: the dialog with the password input field shook left to right a few times, then settled. There was no error message. Until I told her, it wasn't even clear to her that anything had happened. I had to tell her: "That was the wrong password."<br /><br />Later, I pointed this out to her. The feedback she had gotten about her incorrect password had been insufficient. The dialog box quaking horizontally, almost imperceptibly to someone with poor vision, and with no error message, wasn't enough to communicate to her what had occurred.<br /><br />Her immediate response: "Well, it probably would have been clear to someone who's better versed in technology..."<br /><br />"Nope," I cut her off. "It's not your lack of knowledge that's the problem. It was a lack of clear communication from the machine."<br /><br />In discussions about the ease of use of technology, this point is often glossed over. Sure, if your website is difficult to use, people might get frustrated and go use your competitor's website instead. But what do people get frustrated with?<br /><br />From my reading of usability and user experience literature (which is, I'll admit, small in quantity), people will usually do what my mother did: they blame <i>themselves</i>. When technology confuses them, they usually attribute the error to their own lack of understanding or, worse, their feeling of inadequacy in the face of complicated technology.<br /><i><br /></i>In all fairness to the people making this kind of technology: the manufacturers tend to know this, and I think they make an effort to make things easier on the user. But computers are extremely complicated things; there's only so much you can do to abstract the complexity. And if you endow the system with too much hand holding assistance, this can be overbearing for the other users who already know what they're doing. It's a difficult balance to strike.<br /><br />As an engineer, I work to build interfaces that are used by people. I know how tricky this is. We cannot accommodate all use cases for all people. We cannot foresee all possible difficulties that might arise for our users. As technologists, we are trying to be sensitive to the needs of everyone, and trying to <i>understand</i>&nbsp;the needs of everyone, but bear in mind that many of us got into technology as a profession because we exist in that large gray area between Aspies and the neurotypicals. Our understanding of machines often exists in our brains largely to make up for our lack of understanding people.<br /><br />There's a fundamental truth to keep in mind when dealing with technology: computers are dumb. They are only capable of doing precisely what a person, or (more likely) a group of people, has taught them to do. It's not a stretch to say that most groups of people, especially as they grow large, have difficulty in coordinating with each other. That means the glorious technical future that's encroaching into every aspect of our lives, being built by such people, isn't a panacea that's going to deliver us from difficulties; instead, it will increase them exponentially.<br /><br />So, if you get overwhelmed by your computer, phone, car, or whatever Internet of Things device that's destroying your happiness...please, <i>please</i>&nbsp;keep this in mind. You are, in fact, smarter than the machine. It's not you, it's them. Curse the people who made the thing if you must, but don't curse yourself. This will accomplish nothing but reinforcing or widening the gap that we, as a society, should be working to bridge.
