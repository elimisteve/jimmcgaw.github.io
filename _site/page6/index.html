                      In middle school, I had a friend who absolutely hated the popular culture in the United States and the members of his own generation that had embraced it. In particular, he focused on the effect of music. This was in the middle of the 1990's, shortly after Kurt Cobain had decided to recuse his spirit from our world. He felt that the 1960's had been the ideal decade for our country, when the Beatles reigned...

While this doesn't come as a complete surprise, that does little to lessen the emotional blow. I know that two people with whom I worked very closely for the past two years, people I greatly respect, got the axe.<br /><br />I decided to take my sabbatical for personal reasons, but I...

                      I often encounter the argument that, since the mechanisms that govern life within an individual living organism are so incredibly complex, and since the diversity of organism in our world is legion, that this must be evidence of the existence of a Creator.<br /><br />Conversely, others look at the mechanisms that led to the complexity and diversity of the world, and insist that all of it occurred randomly. They reach completely the opposite conclusion: a...
