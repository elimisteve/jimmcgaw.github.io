                      I don't know about you, but whenever someone asks me what I want for Christmas or my birthday, I rarely have an answer for them. There aren't a whole lot of things that I want that I don't just go out and buy for myself as soon as I want them (usually, it's books) and I know better than to ask people for money.Here are some random gift ideas you might ask for, the next...

                      Let's try a quick little thought experiment. Imagine that one of your favorite authors is Malcolm Gladwell. You're in Borders browsing the audiobooks on CD, and you're looking to buy one of the three audiobooks by Gladwell that they have on their shelves. Here are the three choices they have in stock for you to choose from (imagine, also, that you like all of his books equally):1. "What the Dog Saw", Unabridged, 9 Compact Discs...

                      Here's a delightful little story from author Kurt Vonnegut. Unlike most of his delightful stories, he didn't make this one up. It actually happened to him when he was at a party with author Joseph Heller, who wrote a book called Catch-22. The party was hosted by a super-wealthy investor, back when both authors were still alive. The conversation went something like this:Vonnegut: "Joe, how does it make you feel to know that our host...

                      Police officers are assigned the difficult task of patrolling the roads, looking for speeders and issuing tickets to the offenders. Like most jobs, the majority of their time is probably routine, tedium, and paperwork. However, unlike most other jobs, it comes with a good deal more risk than most other jobs. (Depending on where they're working, it might be a lot more risk.)In the course of their work, police officers learn how to spot a...

                      I like it when a big name band puts on a benefit concert, where multitudes of fans pay to see a live performance by their favorite band, but the band donates all of the proceeds to a charity of its choice. U2 is probably the biggest name that comes to mind as having done something like this.This idea, as simple as it is, doesn't have to be exclusive to more well-known artists. You might not...

                      A couple weekends ago, I visited San Luis Obispo, a small college town in the Central Coast of California. They have a quaint little downtown area. One of the highlights the city boasts is an alleyway between two buildings that's about fifty feet long, and on both sides, eight feet high, the walls are completely covered in people's chewing gum. (Translation: they turned one annoying type of litter into a tourist attraction...an interesting concept.)During my...

                      During a long car ride in the middle of the night back during college, the music I was listening to slowly segued into a talk radio show. The host was a guy that I had never heard of named Bill O'Reilly. As the program began, he proceeded to go right into discussing his thoughts on gay marriage and why he felt it shouldn't be legalized. I don't remember the exact details, since this was eight...

                      There's an old expression that reads: "Fine words butter no parsnips."Aerosmith say it in a different way when they sing, "Talk is cheap, shut up and dance."Most people I know (myself included) have a tendency to stall by talking. Instead of doing something, for fear that anything we do will be criticized or ridiculed, we agonize over the "what if...?"s. And that's why procrastination, why talking ideas to death instead of implementing them, is so...

                      Recenly, I read a news release from GM talking about how the company is trying to get rid of the name "Chevy" in people's minds and replace it entirely with the full name "Chevrolet". According to the article, office workers at GM actually have "Chevy jars" (much like "swear jars") that they have to contribute to if they let a "Chevy" slip in conversation. Apparently, General Motors has always tolerated, rather than embraced, this nickname...
