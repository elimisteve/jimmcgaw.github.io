        Let's try a quick little thought experiment. Imagine that one of your favorite authors is Malcolm Gladwell. You're in Borders browsing the audiobooks on CD, and you're looking to buy one of the three audiobooks by Gladwell that they have on their shelves. Here are the three choices they have in stock for you to choose from (imagine, also, that you like all of his books equally):<br /><br />1. "What the Dog Saw", Unabridged, 9 Compact Discs - $26.99<br />2. "The Tipping Point", Unabridged, 9 Compact Discs - $26.99<br />3. "The Tipping Point", Abridged, 3 Compact Discs - $22.99<br /><br />You'll notice that two of the options are the same book, but one is much shorter than the other, as it contains fewer discs. Given the prices and number of discs, which option would you choose?<br /><br />If you're like most people, you probably were leaning towards option number two. The reason for this is simple. Because options one and two are more or less identical. That is, it's the same number of discs for the same price for one of two books you would enjoy equally. The means, when you weigh the first two options, your conclusion is effectively a tie. <br /><br />However, when you compare options two and three, option two emerges as the clear winner, since you get three times as much content for less than 1/5th of additional cost. <br /><br />According to behavioral economists, this matters when you go back and evaluate the first two options. Now that you see option two as being not only comprable, but also quite superior, to option three, it acts as the tiebreaker between the two options. Option three, sharing so much in common with option two and being so obviously inferior to option two, becomes the heuristic that our brains use to distinguish and choose between the first two options.<br /><br />This matters if you happen to have two clear choices you want to offer people, and you want to influence them to choose one option over the other. And making such a choice easier for people makes it more likely that they'll choose one of the two options. Remember, you didn't <em>have</em> to buy an audiobook by Malcolm Gladwell. You could have picked another author. Or you could have simply left the store without buying anything. Given a difficult choice, people will often just avoid choosing any one option if they can.<br /><br />And I'll admit it: faced with this choice, I picked door #2.

        Here's a delightful little story from author Kurt Vonnegut. Unlike most of his delightful stories, he didn't make this one up. It actually happened to him when he was at a party with author Joseph Heller, who wrote a book called <em>Catch-22</em>. The party was hosted by a super-wealthy investor, back when both authors were still alive. The conversation went something like this:<br /><br />Vonnegut: "Joe, how does it make you feel to know that our host only yesterday may have made more money than your novel <em>Catch-22</em> has earned in its entire history?"<br /><br />Heller: "I've got something he can never have." <br /><br />Vonnegut: "What on earth could that be, Joe?" <br /><br />Heller: "The knowledge that I've got enough." <br /><br />In a word: <em>amen</em>.

        Police officers are assigned the difficult task of patrolling the roads, looking for speeders and issuing tickets to the offenders. Like most jobs, the majority of their time is probably routine, tedium, and paperwork. However, unlike most other jobs, it comes with a good deal more risk than most other jobs. (Depending on where they're working, it might be a <em>lot</em> more risk.)<br /><br />In the course of their work, police officers learn how to spot a motorist who isn't following the rules. They develop an ability to spot someone who is driving faster than the posted speed limit or someone who might be swerving around erratically. They're out on patrol in search of this sort of thing, so that when they spot it, they can respond by pulling the person over and possibly issuing them a citation. That's what the eyes of police officers are trained to do: scan for traffic offenders and respond as needed. (I know they do several other things, but I'm keeping this simple.)<br /><br />There's a certain type of person I encounter on the Internet all the time. They post anonymous comments on YouTube videos and blogs. They leave reviews for books on e-commerce sites that level unfair criticism against the author or subject matter. They do it an untactful, pithy way that conveys a flippant disregard for anyone who might hold an opinion differing from their own.<br /><br />Pick a controversial issue: global warming, immigration, assisted suicide, and so on. When they come up, these people immediately feel the urge to speak their mind. It almost seems as if they're brimming with their own opinions and just looking for an opportunity to speak up and start an argument...kind of like someone who needs to vomit really badly cupping their hand over their mouth and running around looking for somewhere they can do it. Once they've found a place to spew, watch out.<br /><br />People are on patrol. They've got their mind on an issue, and their eyes are sweeping the online landscape, looking for disagreement and ignoring everything else, always ready to react to it when they find it.<br /><br />The key thing to note, however, is that police officers are not reacting...they're <em>responding</em> (rare events like Rodney King being the exception.) And this is an important distinction, particularly for those who want to exert a positive influence over others. An emotional reaction is much less likely to win favor than a thoughtful response.

        I like it when a big name band puts on a benefit concert, where multitudes of fans pay to see a live performance by their favorite band, but the band donates all of the proceeds to a charity of its choice. U2 is probably the biggest name that comes to mind as having done something like this.<br /><br />This idea, as simple as it is, doesn't have to be exclusive to more well-known artists. You might not be able to fill a stadium, but if you and a few friends have some musical chops, why not hit the streets and put on your own little "benefit concert" right on the sidewalk? Bring a lockbox and put a sign on it with the logo of the charity of your choice.<br /><br />The Salvation Army has Santa Claus ringing a bell outside stores at Christmastime. That's not musical; it's actually kind of annoying, but there's little else those poor guys can do standing out in the cold like that. Think Christmas in July, when it's warm enough to bring instruments.

        A couple weekends ago, I visited San Luis Obispo, a small college town in the Central Coast of California. They have a quaint little downtown area. One of the highlights the city boasts is an alleyway between two buildings that's about fifty feet long, and on both sides, eight feet high, the walls are completely covered in people's chewing gum. (Translation: they turned one annoying type of litter into a tourist attraction...an interesting concept.)<br /><br />During my visit, I went into a very small independent bookstore. It was no larger than 500 square feet, and the shelves were not the high, so the selection was extremely limited. But most of the major sections were there: fiction, philosophy, history, politics, social science, and so on. <br /><br />And what amazed me was how <em>generalized</em> the selection of books was for being such a small store. If you went to a larger bookstore and took a cross section of the most popular titles from every genre, you'd end up with what this guy had in stock.<br /><br />That was the gist of the selection: the most popular of the most popular. The problem with this particular shop is that if you leave and walk one block down the street, you arrive at a Barnes & Noble. In that case, acting like a tiny, tiny version of Barnes & Noble doesn't make any sense at all. People who want to browse "everything" will go where the selection is more complete.<br /><br />It's nice and PC to stock a little of everything, but who does that appeal to? If I owned a small shop and was going to run a small bookstore, I would draw a line in the sand. Pick a niche, and serve that particular niche as well as you possibly can. <br /><br />If you're going to stock fiction, pick one particular genre, like, for example, horror, and focus on that. You could even set up an area of your store with chairs and a TV showing Stephen King movies. Offer free popcorn. (Popcorn is cheap.)<br /><br />Cal Poly State University (the local college) has a pretty good business school. Why not become the go-to place for students to come and browse new ideas about business and tech?<br /><br />If you've got a political bent and you're conservative, why not stock the shelves with Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly?<br /><br />Sure, these bookstores wouldn't appeal to everyone (and I don't think that last idea would fly in Southern Californa), but the handful of people that did like them would be great customers. Serve them right, and they'd become regulars, and they'd tell any friends that shared that interest.

        During a long car ride in the middle of the night back during college, the music I was listening to slowly segued into a talk radio show. The host was a guy that I had never heard of named Bill O'Reilly. As the program began, he proceeded to go right into discussing his thoughts on gay marriage and why he felt it shouldn't be legalized. <br /><br />I don't remember the exact details, since this was eight years ago, but I remember taking the details of his opinion and "wearing them" for a little while. For a very short period of time, I examined the world through Bill's eyes to see if his opinion resonated with my own perception of the world.<br /><br />I have my own opinion about the whole gay marriage issue, and ultimately, the thoughts I heard expressed by Bill O'Reilly that night did nothing to influence that opinion one way or another. That doesn't mean I wasted my time in seriously considering them. It's not about determining whether or not new information is right or wrong based on what you know or believe, but about using the new information to reconsider your own knowledge or beliefs.<br /><br />I think of political opinions as articles of clothing: you should try them on, walk around in them for a while to see how they fit you, and then shed them if you don't like them. Or, if they suit you, wear them for a little while. And like actual clothing, I think that opinions (especially political ones) need to be "refreshed" from time to time. If you wear the same articles of clothing at length for a long time, without at least taking them off and washing them occasionally, they're going to start to reek.

        There's an old expression that reads: "Fine words butter no parsnips."<br /><br />Aerosmith say it in a different way when they sing, "Talk is cheap, shut up and dance."<br /><br />Most people I know (myself included) have a tendency to stall by talking. Instead of doing something, for fear that anything we do will be criticized or ridiculed, we agonize over the "what if...?"s. And that's why procrastination, why talking ideas to death instead of implementing them, is so contagious: because talking usually begets more talking, not action. When you become defensive instead of ignoring the critic and moving forward, you become them.<br /><br />My best advice: go butter your proverbial parsnips, right now, no excuses. Fine words, indeed...why are you still reading this?

        Recenly, I read a <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20100610/BUSINESS01/100610021/1002/BUSINESS/GM-sheds-Chevy-moniker-will-promote-Chevrolet">news release from GM</a> talking about how the company is trying to get rid of the name "Chevy" in people's minds and replace it entirely with the full name "Chevrolet". According to the article, office workers at GM actually have "Chevy jars" (much like "swear jars") that they have to contribute to if they let a "Chevy" slip in conversation. Apparently, General Motors has always tolerated, rather than embraced, this nickname bestowed upon their cars. <br /><br />Why the resistance? Even if there is an internal memo telling GM employees to say "Chevrolet" (the enforcement of which would be a copious waste of employee effort), why announce it publicly? All they're doing is telling their customers, all those people who are proud to drive their "Chevys" that they're doing something wrong. It's exactly the wrong group of people you want to openly criticize.<br /><br />If your three-year-old daughter wants a second helping of "brocci", you don't hold back and tell her she can only eat it if she corrects her pronunciation and says "broccoli". As a parent, if your daughter wants to eat her veggies, you let her. Grammer takes a backseat.<br /><br />Isn't this part of the reason the American auto industry is in such a mess? Because they ignored what their customers were saying?<br /><br />Branding occurs first and foremost in the mind of the customer, not in your press releases and commercials. The "Chevy" moniker is a <em>meme</em>...if it starts spreading amongst car drivers in the United States, then embrace it. Fight the meme at your peril.

        As a programmer, I'll occasionally browse jobs on Dice.com. For the past year, since getting a steady job, I've been getting at least three emails from them a week. The last one I received contained a list of available positions. Here they are:<br /><br />Raytheon Software Engineer  Riverdale, MD<br />Yahoo Senior Java Developer  Richardson, TX<br />Sapphire Project Manager  Chicago, IL<br />Sapient Senior Manager, Technology (.NET)  Boston, MA<br />Amazon Manager - DBA  Seattle, WA<br /><br />Here's the problem with this: Dice.com knows a phenomenal amount about me as a programmer from the information I've entered into their site. Here are just a few of the problems:<br /><br />1. I live in California, and am not interested in relocating.<br /><br />2. I listed no previous experience with Java.<br /><br />3. I've worked as a developer for three years (if that), I'm not going to qualify for anything position with "Senior" in the title.<br /><br />4. I'm 80% sure that there's a "Are you currently looking for work?" question on their site, and I checked "No".<br /><br />Email marketing isn't as easy as it seems, but Dice made a habit of sending me email after email, the content of which had absolutely nothing to do with me or my work experience. When I finally decided to click "Unsubscribe" at the bottom of the email, it took me to a page when they actually seemed surprised: "Are you sure you want to unsubscribe....?"<br /><br />Yep, I'm sure. I, and everyone else, wants to read "me-email". Dice can do better, and I know it, so they've lost the privilege of communicating with me.

        There's a local band in my town that plays Peruvian jazz. In truth Peruvian style, the guitar player always plays the pan flute instead of a harmonica. He's accompanied by a percussionist on conga drums and a saxophonist. They are an excellent group, and if they're playing in town, I'll go watch them perform when I've got a free evening. <br /><br />At their shows, there's always a video camera set up on a tripod, recording them. This would lead you to believe that amateur videos would inevitably crop up somewhere on social media. On their Facebook page, someone asked them why they don't post videos of their live performances and why they don't make any of their music available online. The guitar player replied, "We're putting together a CD and we hope to be selling it at our shows soon."<br /><br />In short, and to paraphrase Dr. Evil: where's the bone? If I want to tell someone about their music, the only thing I can do is mention a vague "Uh, they play in town, and they've got a Facebook page with some pictures on it, but no music." There's nothing I can spread. There's no way for me to share their essence.<br /><br />It's his music, his art, his passion, so he's got the final say, but I wonder about whether that's the correct approach to things. If I were a musician, and I produced a CD, and someone wanted to listen to the music, I would gladly <em>give</em> them a CD. Better yet, I'd give them MP3s and encourage them to pass them along to anyone interested in them. <br /><br />It's not much about making a sale as it is creating a fan. Throw people a frickin' bone, and make it easy for them to throw it to their friends.
