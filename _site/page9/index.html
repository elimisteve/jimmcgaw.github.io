                      As a virtue, I think that temperance is sorely underrated. In my recent trip to France, surrounded by people who wanted to give me copious amounts of absolutely delicious food, I made an effort to translate the word "temperance" into French. There seems to be no equivalent, even a word that describes the concept.People focus their efforts to get healthier on diets. I've have never tried any of these diets, but most of the major...

                      In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, there have been reports of&nbsp;looting in Egypt. People desperate for money have been ransacking archaeological artifacts from museums and selling them over the Internet. Even worse, tombs in Egypt are being dug up as people delve for items that they can sell for money to feed their families.There are also reports of widespread looting in Syria, where ISIS is doing a lot of the looting in order to...

But yesterday, I had a friend ask me:"Jim, how do you develop your outlook on life?"I thought for a moment, then responded, "Very carefully."To which I would add after the fact: industriously, selectively, enthusiastically, and (to the extent...

                      Like most questions that really matter, there isn't an easy answer to this one.I would say this: a life of virtue is characterized by not allowing your actions to be driven by the whims of your emotions.That may not be the whole story, but it's the only sufficient prologue.

                      When I was in 9th grade, I had an English teacher who insisted that if we wrote in-class essays in pen, that we correct our mistakes with Whiteout."Why can't we just cross out our mistakes and write a correction next to it? Isn't that the same thing as using Whiteout?" I asked. I mean, regardless of how you fix it, if you notice your own error and correct it, what does it matter?"Because," she replied....

                      If you asked me what advice I would give to a young person who is planning to spend their career in a technology-related field, here is what I would offer:Take initiative.Make things.To elaborate on these two points a little: put yourself out there. You have no idea what you are capable of until you do. Start things. Persist in them even when they get difficult.Sure, that is not all&nbsp;you need to do in order to...

                      In the movie Solaris, psychologist Chris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting a distant planet to investigate an odd phenomenon: deceased loved ones of the crew members are appearing on the ship.&nbsp;So, the planet they're orbiting reads Kelvin's mind, learns everything it can about his late wife, and replicates her.What makes this story really interesting is that the replicants are not complete recreations; they are based merely on the memories of those who...

                      There are two different flavors of creativity. The first is the one with which most of us are both intuitively and empirically familiar: the "aha" moment. It is the spark that comes from talking to a bunch of strangers in an evening with varying interests.
