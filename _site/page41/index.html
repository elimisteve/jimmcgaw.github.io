        Nobody's selling used stuff as with as much gusto, effort, and enthusiasm as new stuff. Manufacturers create new widgets and incentivize their sales force to peddle them. Outside of the Antique Roadshow, we usually don't place a whole lot of value on old and used junk, even if we are able to use it. The kitchen stuff at your local Salvation Army doesn't have a snowball's chance against the goods at Sur La Table.<br /><br />In Coca-Cola's world, everyone drinks a 12-pack of coke a day. But even that is a cap. You cannot have growth on top of growth on top of growth, and on and on, forever. The buck has to stop somewhere. Perhaps Coke should try pushing a product on people that doesn't contribute to obesity. Libertarians would surely tell me that in a more perfect world, consumers would demand such a product.<br /><br />Too many mergers and acquisitions is counter to nature's preference for small. Sure, insects don't live long and their survival rate per batch is relatively low, but the larger an organism is, the more susceptible it is to changes in its environment. Sheer size comes at the cost of adaptability and agility.<br /><br />You can't post "Cigarettes not purchased" on the income statement. A lack of a harmful product being purchased by consumers doesn't help anyone's bottom line. (Maybe Nicorette's.) Net benefit to society doesn't always contribute to net income, unless someone creates a business model to make it happen.

        There are some days when I wake up, days when my head isn't so far up my own ass that I take everything I have for granted, and I start to wonder how I got so lucky as to be where I am. I start to question whether or not I deserve everything that I have.<br /><br /><em>Deserve</em> is a funny word, because it's a means of evaluating the balance between the merits of one's actions and the good (or bad) fortune a person incurs. It's a subjective thing to try and define, so ultimately, most of us end up concluding that we deserve what we have.<br /><br />Of myself, I'm still skeptical. I've had a lot of good luck in my days (so far) and I have a hard time convincing myself that I've really done anything to earn it. Dumb luck, I suppose you could call it. But ultimately, it doesn't do anyone any good to sit idly and question whether they deserve what they have. A much better question to ask: what are you going to do with your good fortune now that you have it?

        My friend Brad owns somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 snakes. He lives in a single room in house with other people. In that little room he has a few dozen drawers, cubbyholes, and terrariums where the snakes live, and right smack dab in the middle of it all is the bed where the sleeps. It's an interesting place to visit. (I sometimes wonder how often he brings girls home from the bar and, when he does, how they react.)<br /><br />Brad is a web developer, and since he recently came into a whole lot of spare time (he isn't working right now), he created a <a href="http://serpentrack.com/">website for snake owners to share their collection online</a>, as well as manage feeding schedules and expenses.<br /><br />The thing I like about this project: it's not for everyone. I think people get really excited about starting a coffeehouse, or a frozen yogurt boutique, because just about everyone drinks coffee and indulges in frozen yogurt. They're easy to accept because it seems like there's very little risk involved.<br /><br />Brad went in the other direction. Sure, only a small number of people in the world own a snake collection (compared to the proportion of cat owners), and of those few, only a few might have an interest in using online software to manage their collection. But it's a niche that's large enough. He found a market that wasn't being served, and built something for them. And not because anyone asked him to, or paid him to...he just had an itch.<br /><br />Now he has a bit of a challenge: convince snake owners that they could benefit from using his site. Snake owners have been feeding their snakes for years without the Internet, and they're probably used to it, so it doesn't feel like they have a problem. How do you sell a solution to a problem that people aren't even aware they have?

        Most of us haven't been trained to recognize a good idea when it strikes us, or to pursue a new path. If my twenty or so years of education taught me anything, it was to follow and comply with the authority figures in my life. Stay in line, don't speak too loudly, and you won't end up being humiliated in front of the rest of your classmates.<br /><br />It was in seventh grade math, when my teacher, Ms. Gilbert, refused to accept my application to test into honors math one day past the day it was due. This wasn't because her hands were bound by the deadline, or because she was trying to teach me a lesson in punctuality (although I needed it at the time.) She was doing it just because she didn't much like me. She never told me that...but I knew.<br /><br />I took what she did that day and realized that adults were, sometimes, just big kids that had been alive longer than me. It was my first lesson in questioning authority, which is something a lot of people never learn in their lives. Most people recognize the need to do this during their teenage years, and it largely shapes who we later become as adults.<br /><br />While questioning authority can be useful, and can be helpful in uncovering problems, it's not perfect. It can be perceived as antagonistic, and once you start a conflict, both sides become defensive about their positions. That doesn't move things forward.<br /><br />Better than questioning authority is to just <em>assume</em> authority where you can. Instead of always asking permission, or waiting for some external source to validate what you're doing, take the initiative, assume you're in charge, and plow ahead. This opens you up for criticism, sure...but few individuals have ever started changing the world by asking someone else's permission. <br /><br />Assuming authority doesn't work in classrooms in public schools, and that's the reason that so few people ever learn how, when, or even <em>that</em> they should bother doing it. By the time we reach the adult world, and we wind up sitting in a cubicle or at a desk someplace, we follow the rules most of the time, and occasionally, we question them.<br /><br />But what's missing, and what you have the opportunity to bring to the table, is initiative. And regardless of the state of the economy, that is a great resume builder.

        I keep the local police department and fire department non-emergency phone numbers programmed into my phone. It's pretty easy to remember 9-1-1 in an emergency, but for little things, I find it pays to keep those numbers handy, because for something small and insignificant, I'm going to have to overcome a lot of inertia to track them down.<br /><br />A few months ago I was walking down the street and came across a trash can that was smoldering. Not an emergency. I called the police department and let them know about it, then flagged down the truck when it arrived. That kind of thing.<br /><br />Smart phones will probably solve this problem for us, sooner or later. There will be an app you can install that will automatically pull up the local police and fire departments for you, automatically, wherever you happen to be at that moment. But the number of people with smart phones is still pretty small, so I tried to think of a way to spread them in a community that didn't involve a mobile app.<br /><br />My conclusion is to use a simple meme: a business card. Print a few hundred that read "Put these numbers in your phone, then pass this along to a friend", and it lists the local numbers. Spread them around and encourage people to pass them forward. <br /><br />I might actually do this. Can anyone out there think of a better solution than the one I just proposed?

        The extras included with the first season DVD of "Lost" include the casting auditions by the actors and actresses reading from the pilot script. While I was watching them, something didn't quite sit right with me. Sure, it's intriguing to see Matthew Fox up there reading for the part of Jack Shepard...but I realized that while seeing the actors who landed the roles on the show was interesting, it would be equally interesting and insightful to see some of the runners-up who auditioned for those roles, but ultimately weren't chosen.<br /><br />What kinds of people auditioned to be Jack Shephard and didn't make the cut? If you're an aspiring actor hoping to break into television, that would be the kind of question you'd need to ask. It's easy for people to look at Matthew Fox's audition and say, "Yeah, he's perfect for the role!" because ultimately, as viewers of the show, we've already typecast him in our own minds. <br /><br />There's a common bias at play here. More often than not, it's described by people who say something like, "History is written by winners." We see successes, because they get all the attention, and so we're duped into believing that success is all the more likely to happen to us.<br /><br />Take Starbucks: there are dozens of books written about the coffee giant, about how Howard Schultz built the company steadily, how they managed the brand, and so on. But all of these books tell a story that, while fascinating, is still very much incomplete. The world doesn't work in simple, explainable ways. Most of the events that happen in our world, including what businesses fail and which succeed, are governed largely by chance, luck, and small elements of chaos. <br /><br />Skill plays a big role, too...but to understand how Starbucks became the de facto coffeehouse in the country, you can't simply look at what Starbucks <em>did</em> and then describe the reasons for causality between strategy and outcome. This kind of analysis suffers from <em>hindsight bias</em>. To determine more accurately how Starbucks managed to end up on top, you'd have to look at all of the other coffee bars that started up or operated in that era and examine what they didn't do, or reasons why they failed. Then, and only then, would you start to get a clear picture about what led to the Starbucks empire.<br /><br />Whenever I get hired for a job, I always wonder about the other candidates that were interviewed and turned down for the position I'm filling.

        A friend of mine on Facebook posted something rather interesting recently:<br /><br />"Guy at work just bet me $1,500 that I couldn't go a year with no diet coke, no coffee, and no red meat."<br /><br />I've heard bets like this before. and I dimly recall being offered a couple of these during my college years. I never took anyone up on them, but if the opportunity came up again, no matter what the stakes were, I would probably do it.<br /><br />We're rarely incentivized to make any kind of change in our lives. If anyone offered me money to change some non-trivial aspect of my lifestyle (and even trivial aspects of our lives have non-trivial implications), I'd probably go with it just out of curiosity, to see what other stuff would change.<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone to offer you the action, however, there is a site out there that lets you bet on yourself: <a href="http://www.stickk.com/">Stickk.com</a>. The premise is very simple: imagine, for example, that you want to quit smoking...you wager a substantial amount of money, say around $1000, that says you won't smoke for six months. If, at the end of six months, you haven't fallen off the wagon and lit up, you get your money back. Otherwise, the money gets donated to a charity of your choosing. You can set it up so that your friends know about it and have control over whether you get the money back or not, so it's slightly better than the honor system.<br /><br />It's a funny little project that cropped up due to the rising popularity of behavioral economics in academia. Imagine someone paying you to follow through on your New Year's resolution. Now, imagine that they tax you if you give up and fail to achieve your goal. One of the reasons that the latter is more effective is because of an old, simple principle: the fear of loss is greater than the desire for gain.

        As I reach 30, I'm starting to realize it's probably a very slippery slope to developing the attitude of a curmudgeon. Granted, I don't consider myself very old, but technology has grown by leaps and bounds since I was a teenager. When I was in high school, cell phones were far from ubiquitous. Smart phones were the stuff of science fiction and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0582402115/">book Bill Gates was wrote at the time</a>.<br /><br />Naturally, we're now living in a time when teenagers can't really a remember a time when such technology wasn't everywhere. They're getting their driver's licenses after they've been blogging, Facebooking, and tweeting for years already, which has interesting implications for how they're going to deal with mobile devices while driving.<br /><br />Marc Pensky coined a term for this generation of kids: <em>digital natives</em>. And while it's very easy to grumble about "these young whipper snappers" when they almost walk into you on the sidewalk while mindlessly thumbing a touchscreen, there are other interesting and more important trends.<br /><br />Today's teenager is much less of a content <em>creator</em> than a mere consumer. In the face of the Internet, communication is easier than ever before, and that has afforded creative collaboration amongst groups online. They've learned cooperative creation through technology. (These kinds of studies are <a href="http://pewinternet.org/">documented at Pew</a>.)<br /><br />One of the more astonishing facts: today's teenagers are two to three times more likely to spend their time helping someone else create their website, instead of just their own. This is, I think, an immensely important point. They're not just better collaborators, but in some ways they have a greater sense of generosity than their older counterparts. This makes sense, since participation is more fun if you're acting as part of a larger group.<br /><br />That's something we old people shouldn't scoff at. We could learn a thing or two from them.

        (Does whatever a spider cup does?)<br /><br />This seems like a somewhat common problem: woman sees spider in her house and, since she cannot bring herself to kill something "icky", traps it under a cup. That leaves her with a small dilemma: the spider is still alive, and she either has to let it starve or asphyxiate, or she can cross her fingers, pull up the cup really quickly and whap the space under it with a magazine. Hopefully, she kills it before it scampers away.<br /><br />So here's a simple specification for a spider-killing cup:<br /><br />1. Cylindrical in shape; the diameter doesn't taper from one end to the other, and an opening on one end.<br /><br />2. Has a plunger that, when pushed, will push a circle down to close the open end. (This kills the spider.)<br /><br />3. The end of this plunger has several layers of a tissue-like substance covering its surface. <br /><br />4. When you retract the plunger after the kill, the lowest layer of tissue crumbles itself up into a ball and falls out.<br /><br />Something for us to work on while we wait for Mother Nature to engineer an ecosystem that doesn't depend on creatures with eight legs.
