                      Nobody's selling used stuff as with as much gusto, effort, and enthusiasm as new stuff. Manufacturers create new widgets and incentivize their sales force to peddle them. Outside of the Antique Roadshow, we usually don't place a whole lot of value on old and used junk, even if we are able to use it. The kitchen stuff at your local Salvation Army doesn't have a snowball's chance against the goods at Sur La Table.In Coca-Cola's...

                      There are some days when I wake up, days when my head isn't so far up my own ass that I take everything I have for granted, and I start to wonder how I got so lucky as to be where I am.

                      My friend Brad owns somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 snakes. He lives in a single room in house with other people. In that little room he has a few dozen drawers, cubbyholes, and terrariums where the snakes live, and right smack dab in the middle of it all is the bed where the sleeps. It's an interesting place to visit. (I sometimes wonder how often he brings girls home from the bar and, when...

                      Most of us haven't been trained to recognize a good idea when it strikes us, or to pursue a new path. If my twenty or so years of education taught me anything, it was to follow and comply with the authority figures in my life. Stay in line, don't speak too loudly, and you won't end up being humiliated in front of the rest of your classmates.It was in seventh grade math, when my teacher,...

                      I keep the local police department and fire department non-emergency phone numbers programmed into my phone. It's pretty easy to remember 9-1-1 in an emergency, but for little things, I find it pays to keep those numbers handy, because for something small and insignificant, I'm going to have to overcome a lot of inertia to track them down.A few months ago I was walking down the street and came across a trash can that was...

                      The extras included with the first season DVD of "Lost" include the casting auditions by the actors and actresses reading from the pilot script. While I was watching them, something didn't quite sit right with me. Sure, it's intriguing to see Matthew Fox up there reading for the part of Jack Shepard...but I realized that while seeing the actors who landed the roles on the show was interesting, it would be equally interesting and insightful...

                      A friend of mine on Facebook posted something rather interesting recently:"Guy at work just bet me $1,500 that I couldn't go a year with no diet coke, no coffee, and no red meat."I've heard bets like this before. and I dimly recall being offered a couple of these during my college years. I never took anyone up on them, but if the opportunity came up again, no matter what the stakes were, I would probably...

                      As I reach 30, I'm starting to realize it's probably a very slippery slope to developing the attitude of a curmudgeon. Granted, I don't consider myself very old, but technology has grown by leaps and bounds since I was a teenager. When I was in high school, cell phones were far from ubiquitous. Smart phones were the stuff of science fiction and a book Bill Gates was wrote at the time.Naturally, we're now living in...

                      (Does whatever a spider cup does?)This seems like a somewhat common problem: woman sees spider in her house and, since she cannot bring herself to kill something "icky", traps it under a cup.
