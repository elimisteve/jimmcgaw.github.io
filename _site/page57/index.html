        There are lots of people living on the streets in Santa Barbara, where I live. A lot of the more enterprising ones have musical instruments, like guitars or djembes, and manage to get small bits of cash from performing on the street.<br /><br />I overheard a conversation about these people. One person remarked about how talented so many of them are. The other person agreed, saying, "It seems like they're good enough to be discovered by someone."<br /><br />I know what that means. If you're a starving musician, being "discovered" means a talent scout from a record company finds you, recognizes your potential, invests in your talent, helps you produce an album, markets you and the music, and then distributes your music to the masses.<br /><br />Cassette tape decks were prevalent for so many years in automobiles that I still occasionally get into a friend's car and see one on the dash. It's an outmoded technology almost two decades over, but it stuck around for a very long time. Part of this is because we invented technology to connect new to the old. I drove around for a couple of years with a Discman on the seat next to me that plugged into the cassette deck in my first car. <br /><br />The reason is simple: people like me don't buy a new car very often, and when I do, it's a used one, so the way it plays music tends to be behind the times. Now the car I drive has a CD player, but I can't hook my iPod up to it.<br /><br />Our perception of what it takes to be a musician seems as stuck in a lot of people's heads as those cassette decks. All it takes to be a record producer these days is a laptop computer (which could be one of those cheap netbooks), some software (it's included on those new Macs), and some musical ability to play an instrument. (preferably well enough that people are willing to listen) <br /><br />And now all you need to get it out there for people to hear is MySpace. (and maybe some guts to upload the songs for public scrutiny in the first place)<br /><br />Cheaper hardware, software, and the Internet has made potential talent scouts out of all of us. There's often people playing they're instruments on the street. Who's to say you can't "discover" them yourself and help them make their art?

        People don't fear change just because it's different or new. They're afraid of it because of its higher level of perceived risk over that of the status quo.<br /><br />If you work for a company and see an opportunity for improvement, it may be hard to pitch the idea to management because they're stuck in their ways. If what they've always done has worked, then why bother fixing it?<br /><br />As long as the status quo appears less risky, people resist change. So how do you sell people on changing this? Reframe the status quo to appear more risky than the change you're proposing. Yes, it's fighting fire with fire; you're turning people's fear against itself by giving them a different perspective. But in a lot of cases, it might be the only chance you have of convincing them.<br /><br />There's no way that Obama's campaign slogan of "Change we can believe in" would have worked in the 1996 election. The economy was soaring, we were in peacetime, and Tom Green had yet to garner widespread publicity in the media. Things were going too well. People would have viewed change as a threat, not an opportunity.<br /><br />In the climate of mid-2008, however, the notion of change became a necessary evil we had to face. People voted as such.<br /><br />It would have been much more difficult to sell the American people on the 2003 Iraq War without the events of 9/11. An attack on home soil got people ready to mobilize for war, because not doing so started to seem like more of a threat than not doing it.<br /><br />Selling is not about reciting facts, but a transference of emotion. If you can make people uncomfortable with what is, and turn the status quo into an itch that seems to need scratching, you might be able to convince them to consider the change.

        According to the old adage, springtime brings about a natural inclination in minds of young men to start chasing skirts. Supposedly, something in the air just makes males more likely to venture out on the prowl.<br /><br />I wonder if this natural drive manifests itself in other ways? Are men more likely to start looking for new jobs when spring rolls around? That information might be useful to headhunters and recruiting firms. <br /><br />I've never paid any attention to how much my own level of initiative goes up during the springtime. For those of us that are already in relationships, I wonder if this is the time to pursue new ideas or dreams? If I'm right, then I should have an easier time convincing people around me to take risks right along with me.<br /><br />Time to get to work.

        Do you teach people how to be spiritual:<br /><br />By trying really hard to teach them how to be spiritual?<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />By showing them how to let the spirituality that exists within them to flourish? <br /><br />I think educators faces a similar question: Do you try to educate kids into being brilliant or do you work to let the brilliance within flourish?

        If you write a book that people read, and it's sold on Amazon, it might get one-star reviews from people that haven't even read it.<br /><br />If you're an independent musician and you put your music on MySpace for all to hear, you'll probably get some wall posts telling you that you sound exactly like [insert popular band here], and that you lack originality, so you should stop trying to record music.<br /><br />If you start making videos and putting them on YouTube, people will leave comments saying your videos suck and that you shouldn't waste your time making them. (And eventually, that comment thread will inevitably turn into a debate about religion, politics, or whether or not the U.S. government was behind 9/11.)<br /><br />Critics are looking for enablers. Without the courage (or capacity) to create something of their own, they'd rather tell you to stop then take the chance themselves.

        When you think about it, the Beatles were basically the "boy band" of the 1960s. It didn't really get interesting until they started dropping acid and doing heavy drugs, which led to "Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and beyond.<br /><br />So, here's an idea: take Justin Timberlake, the Jonas Brothers, and Hannah Montana, put them into a studio for six months, and make them take drugs. LSD, crack, heroine, cocaine, and all the booze they can drink. Give them a producer who has an uncanny knack for breaking barriers to help them out. As musicians, let's see what they're all really capable of creating.<br /><br />One of two things will come from this drug- and alcohol-fueled session:<br /><br />1. We'll get some good music out of these musicians for a change, or<br /><br />2. We'll get terrible, obnoxious, unlistenable auditory garbage. This will help dispel the widely held, but mistaken, myth that drugs and alcohol are somehow a prerequisite to creating good music.<br /><br />My money is on the latter happening. And I guarantee that any publicity surrounding the event would be much more effective at discouraging kids from doing drugs than any one thing that D.A.R.E. ever did.

        I go to a dentist that is very much in touch with newer technology. I get reminders about my upcoming appointments by phone call, SMS text message, and email. Personally, I don't mind this, because I opted in to have these alerts send to me, and it's convenient for me because I don't have to worry about forgetting when I have an appointment.<br /><br />All of the reminders I get say the same thing: "Don't be late." They ask me to arrive five minutes early if possible, but if nothing else, ask that I show up on time. The only problem I have with this is that the last four out of five times I've visited this particular dentist, I've ended up waiting between five and fifteen minutes past my appointment time, just sitting in the waiting room. (And they have the same lame magazines as every other dentist, so now I bring a book.)<br /><br />Now, I'm a reasonable person, and my employer doesn't care if my lunch hour runs over by twenty minutes every now and then. And I'd be the first person to concede that my doctor's time really <em>is</em> more valuable than my own. He's a <em>doctor</em>, for God's sake, he suffered through medical school and has to deal with grumpy patients whining about their teeth all day. Can't we cut him some slack?<br /><br />Sure, and I do. But lots of his other patients may not. How many of them hate being asked to show up on time, only to be left waiting for fifteen minutes when they do? Seems to me that asking people for something, but not taking the trouble to return the favor, is just going to annoy people.

        It's odd how many blogs you come across where the writer starts, ends, or both starts and ends his post with something like this:<br /><br />"I know I'm not a real writer, but I'm trying."<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />"Don't feel you have to read this."<br /><br />Those are pretty short, but sometimes, the explanation is very long-winded and can be an entire paragraph. I don't think there's a single better way to make people want to stop reading than to bother cluttering up your post with a message like that.<br /><br />"Real" writers, even those that have published books you can buy at your local Borders that have the word "Bestseller" on the cover, get lots of criticism. Those writers know it, and they don't waste any of their time fearing criticism. Is it because they're bestselling authors that they get to ignore what critics say? No, it's the other way around: they're bestselling authors <em>because</em> they write without letting that fear get in the way.<br /><br />Stephen King's most recent book, <em>Under The Dome</em>, has 700 reviews on Amazon, about 250 of which are one-, two-, and three-star reviews. Stephen King isn't sitting at computer sweating those reviews. He's writing his next one.<br /><br />I asked a friend of mine if he would mind if I read a short story he had written. He said no, so I asked him to send it to me in an e-mail. I had to remind him a couple of times. When he finally did send it to me, he said, in the body of the e-mail: "Here's the story you've been asking me for. Don't take it too seriously because I wrote it a long time ago and I don't care about it anymore."<br /><br />After that, do you think I bothered to read it? <br /><br />Never be self-deprecating if you're just trying to preemptively discourage or address criticism, and never do it at the expense of your reader's attention. Say what you want to say, in your own voice, and say it now. Don't apologize.

        We need sociologists and business people to start having sex with each other. We need their offspring.<br /><br />Okay, maybe the sex part isn't something we <em>literally</em> need, but we do need a fusion of the two. We need people who have the conscience and socially responsible attitude of sociologists as well as the vision and strategy of entrepreneurs. The people who think in the overlap between sociology's idealism and business' pragmatism are the ones who need to start leading the rest of us.<br /><br />Older companies have a way of functioning that ignores social needs, and they try to write it off by cutting checks to charities in an effort to make up for whatever damage they might be doing for society. Not good enough. People in business need to become sociologists, and vice versa. They need to start companies in this middle ground.<br /><br />At my local Borders, the Social Science section and Business sections are two stories apart from one another. That's too much running around for one person to do.

        During my first year of college, Napster broke onto the scene. Suddenly, every single student with a computer (which, I think, was everyone except me) was able to get their hands on just about any song or album just by typing it into a program and downloading it.<br /><br />Soon thereafter, Lars Ulrich, the drummer in Metallica, spoke up, claiming that Napster was a threat to the control that musician's should be able to retain over their music. Suddenly, an intense debate erupted over whether or not people should be allowed to use their computers to share music with one another.<br /><br />Lars Ulrich had a point, and a good one, but he got it wrong when he first spoke up. He claimed that people should be forced to pay for music, so if they wanted to listen to songs, they should buy the CDs and not download them illegally. People responded by calling Lars and his Metallica buddies "greedy", and painted them as a profiteering band without any artistic values. He probably realized his mistake later, and he tried to clarify that he wasn't interested in money, but rather in ensuring that artists retain creative control over the music they produce. But the damage was done.<br /><br />The problem is that Lars Ulrich sparked entirely the wrong debate between the music industry and the people who listen to it. The question should never have been, "Should we let people share music with each other, even if they haven't paid for it?" That muddied the real issue. Music fans argued yes, they ought to be allowed to, taking a decidedly less-than-selfless stance on the issue. The RIAA said no, and tried really hard to get Napster shut down as quickly as possible, which made music fans hate them. It polarized everyone.<br /><br />We did not need Lars Ulrich appealing to music listeners, telling them they had to pay for music. We needed Lars Ulrich on our side, using his position in the music industry on behalf of music fans everywhere, to tell the record companies, "This is the future of music distribution. In the coming years, people will buy music downloads on their computers, not walk to the store to buy CDs. We need to set up a way so that people can buy all the music they want, legally, using an officially sanctioned Napster that we create."<br /><br />The question shouldn't have involved the rest of us. The RIAA should have asked itself: in the face of the future, how are we going to leverage an extremely cost efficient distribution network to help people get the music that they want? If they had carefully considered that question, they would have continued making money, they would have kept the music artists happy, and we, as music fans, would probably have abandoned Napster and switched to the RIAA's new means of selling us music.<br /><br />Ideally, they would have done it long before Napster. They should have. It's the classic example of a "stuck" company that's asleep at the helm.<br /><br />They didn't consider the story from the student's perspective. If you're a record executive and you live in the suburbs, you get in your Mercedes-Benz and drive to buy a CD at Circuit City or Best Buy. Simple and convenient. From that standpoint, it ain't broke, so there's nothing to fix.<br /><br />During my freshman year at college, I experienced a much different story. I was in the dorms, surrounded by students who loved music, passionately. None of us had cars. The closest music store was a Tower Records that was a good twenty minute walk from the dorm where I lived. A CD at Tower Records was five dollars more than it was at the Best Buy, which was three miles up the road off campus. Picture trying to get to either of these places, on foot or by bus, in the middle of a frigid January, and finding that the CD you came to buy is out of stock, and having to turn around and go home empty-handed.<br /><br />If you present that story, it's obvious that something's broken.<br /><br />To a student in the dorms, Napster was all the music you could ever want, without having to venture out of your dorm room. You could get just one song off of an album, so you didn't need to buy the entire Destiny's Child CD just to hear the song "Survivor". And if you thought "Bombs Over Baghdad" was a great song, you didn't have to commit to buying an entire Outkast CD before determining whether or not you'd like the rest of their songs.<br /><br />It's almost ten years later, and finally, it's possible to buy music using iTunes, or using the DRM-free Amazon MP3. It took longer than it should have because everyone was busy arguing the "correct" answer to the wrong question.
