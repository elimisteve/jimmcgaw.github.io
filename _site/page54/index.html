                      There's an old expression about how if someone gives you a hammer, suddenly, everything in the world starts to look like a nail. I think it's important that you figure out what kind of hammer you have, and that at any given time, you have something in front of you that needs pounding. And then, keep on pounding till it's finished. Repeat as necessary.

                      In an era when you can share your ideas online, using a blog, for free, why would anyone take the trouble to write a book? As a writer offering your ideas, the last thing you should be trying to do is making money selling books.

                      When you think about it, Miles Per Gallon is really only a useful metric if you consider it in relative terms. You know that a car getting 35 MPG is generally accepted as being more environmentally-friendly than a cart that's getting, say, 17 MPG. Honda Civics tend to consume less gasoline per mile traveled than Hummers do, and since Civics conserve gasoline relative to Hummers, we look at them favorably.By if you're driving in a...

                      Take the following image of a pig. What do you see?If you're in the United States, you know that this image represents more than just a pig. Culturally, it's much more than that. It's an icon that we associate with financial prudence, of socking away money for retirement or a rainy day. They're used as teaching devices to solidify the concept of saving to children. Banks and financial institutions use them to promote products or...

                      I've got my mind set on buying a Roomba. I'm not in any hurry, and so far, I haven't felt the urge to spend a few hundred dollars on one of these little vacuum cleaners, but one day, I plan to get one. And I'll tell you why.The first time I ever saw one was in an episode of the TV Show "Arrested Development". The mother on the show is explaining that she had to...

                      Just over a hundred years ago, Francis Galton set out to prove that the majority of people are stupid. He devised a very simple experiment: take an ox into a public place and have lots of random people guess at how many pounds the ox weighed. He hypothesized that a few intelligent people would get close to the correct answer, but that the majority of people would be way off the mark.Francis Galton was the...

                      There was an episode of Penn and Teller's "Bullshit!" (which is a kind of quasi-political "Mythbusters" hosted by two libertarians) where people were sent with clipboards into a big outdoor event filled with environmentalists. They carried with them a petition to ban "dihydrogen monoxide" from our nation's lakes, reservoirs, and water supply. Dihydrogen monoxide being, of course, just ordinary water.
