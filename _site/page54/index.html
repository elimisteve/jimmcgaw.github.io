        There's an old expression about how if someone gives you a hammer, suddenly, everything in the world starts to look like a nail. I think it's important that you figure out what kind of hammer you have, and that at any given time, you have something in front of you that needs pounding. <br /><br />And then, keep on pounding till it's finished. Repeat as necessary.

        Wherever you're reading this, scroll to the top of this page you're on and have a look at the links. Next to the search box and the "Report Abuse" link, there's a link with the text "Next Blog >>>". Go ahead, have a look...I'll wait here until you get back.<br /><br />See it? If you click it, it will propel you away from my blog and into another random person's. Some days, when I get bored, I'll use that link to jump around Blogger and see what other random people are sharing with one another.<br /><br />Most of the time, all I learn is that most people use Blogger to share fairly uninteresting photos of their family, and lots of people write one entry per year in which they say, "Sorry I haven't been blogging, I'm going to try and do it more often!"<br /><br />But the "Next Blog" link offers a certain measure of controlled serendipity. I'm curious to know just how many people take advantage of the fact that, at any given time, you can use Blogger to effectively browse people and their ideas, entirely at random. It's akin to wandering around Borders looking for a good book to read...maybe one that you weren't looking for the first place.

        If you are, I can guess why: it's either because you know me personally and are friends with me on Facebook, or it's because you've stumbled across this blog from a search engine somehow. If it's the latter, my guess is that you're not going to read all the way till the end of this sentence.<br /><br />There are lots of writers on the Internet. A lot of them have really great ideas and seem like really smart cookies. But I don't read all of them on a daily basis. I can't. At the same time, there are a lot of talented musicians out there who are producing a lot of great music. But I'm not listening to all of them. There just aren't enough hours in the day.<br /><br />I read personal blogs and listen to music on the Internet for one of three reasons:<br /><br />1. I know the creator personally.<br />2. I'm deriving value or enjoyment out of the content.<br />3. I feel like I'm part of something that's bigger than just the creator and me combined.<br /><br />You're probably here for the first reason mentioned. Maybe you've been coming back here and there for the second reason. (If so, I'm humbled, and thank you.) But what separates the big winners in writing, music, and art is when the interaction of the viewer and the artist becomes more than just a sum of its parts. When the viewer feels like they're joining a community, and becoming a part of something, that's when art really meets with success.<br /><br />I can strike up a conversation with a lot of random people I meet about Dan Brown's books, the Mona Lisa, or the music of Lady Gaga. It becomes easy to create and join communities, both locally and on a much larger scale on the Internet. This ability to do this is what draws people in. It's not just how good your art is, or how accessible the message is, or how much you spend on marketing.<br /><br />People are filtering you, your content, and your message based on how easily they can use what you're giving them to self-actualize and connect with other human beings like themselves.

        There's a guy following me on Google Buzz. I don't know him personally, so he's one of those random strangers I connected with after Buzz opened the floodgates. His name is Jay T. Deragon, and he's one of the authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Relationship-Economy-Order-Things/dp/1600050816/">this book</a>. Like me, he has a <a href="http://www.relationship-economy.com/">blog about marketing</a> that he updates pretty frequently, and I find his posts very interesting.<br /><br />But I'm not following him back. The reason is because every day, when Jay releases a new blog post, he insists on feeding it into Google Buzz and Twitter at least half a dozen different ways. Different posts, with different text and hashtags. He's hoping that by putting the links to his content out there several different ways, it will increase the chances that new readers will discover his blog.<br /><br />Jay's not alone in doing this. On Twitter, the <em>New Yorker</em> does this too. Every new article is posted several times, with different keywords and hashtags. The <a href="http://www.greensherpa.com/">company that I work for</a> does this with their Twitter account, too.<br /><br />The logic behind the strategy makes sense. Cast a wide net and hope you manage to rope in more readers. But I think this is completely the wrong way to go about trying to build an audience. The reason? If I followed any of these people, my own personal feed of people I follow would be needlessly cluttered up with posts from these people. So while people might be more likely to stumble upon you, you destroy some of the incentive to turn those stumblers into followers, who will continue to see what you produce in the future and may eventually become customers. (I think marketers call this "building brand".)<br /><br />Hearing about your post once is enough. And if you ask me, once or twice a day is often enough for me to hear from you, unless you have something really interesting to say.

        In an era when you can share your ideas online, using a blog, for free, why would anyone take the trouble to write a book? <br /><br />As a writer offering your ideas, the last thing you should be trying to do is making money selling books. Sure, a select few authors hit a home run and manage to pull down some decent residual income from royalties, but if that's what you set out to do, you're going to be disappointed when your book doesn't end up on the bestseller list and you're going to get discouraged.<br /><br />But, if you're in it for reputation, like a lot of writers are, you can disseminate your ideas for free. 12 chapters of a book can be released as blog posts, once a month, for a year. All this can be done for free, without soliciting a publisher for start-up money. (If you're currently shopping for a publisher, that's what you're really doing.)<br /><br />There are some reasons. First, a book is a relic. You hand someone a book full of ideas and it conveys more authority. When someone hands another person a book, that gets more attention than a hyperlink in an email. A hard copy of a book says that the ideas contained between its covers have been tested and are generally well-researched and accepted by a bigger group of people. That might not be true, but the book still gives us that impression.<br /><br />Also, it conveys commitment on the part of the writer. Blogs tend to be disjointed, short little nuggets in which people express their opinions. You can write a blog post (like this one) that doesn't require more than commitment of a few minutes of time. Consequently, blogs are everywhere, and their actual content lies somewhere between a book and a single Tweet. <br /><br />Although, if you're really looking for a book deal, here's my advice: start a blog and write often. If you've got a story to share, post the first half of it online for free, using Blogger, Wordpress, or Typepad. Don't wait for one of those big publishing companies to see the value in your writing and offer you a cash advance to get started.<br /><br />Publishing companies are in the business of selling books. Writers are in the business of disseminating ideas and telling stories. Make sure you don't confuse the two.

        When you think about it, Miles Per Gallon is really only a useful metric if you consider it in relative terms. You know that a car getting 35 MPG is generally accepted as being more environmentally-friendly than a cart that's getting, say, 17 MPG. Honda Civics tend to consume less gasoline per mile traveled than Hummers do, and since Civics conserve gasoline relative to Hummers, we look at them favorably.<br /><br />By if you're driving in a car that has a MPG meter on it, so that at any given moment, you can glance down at the dashboard and know just how many MPG you're getting, given the conditions of the road and the way you're driving.<br /><br />MPG helps in comparisons between cars, but does it really help you to know exactly what MPG you're getting from your car at any given time? Presumably, the gauge is there so people will be able to adjust their driving behavior according to it, to lessen their impact on the environment. But the MPG measurement doesn't communicate that...it's just a number. It helps us make fuel-economy comparisons between cars, and between the highway and city driving of a single car...but beyond that, it doesn't tell you anything useful. (I suppose it is a good red flag that tells you when there might be a problem in the engine.)<br /><br />If your car could tell you something besides just a number, what would you want to hear?

        Take the following image of a pig. What do you see?<br /><br /><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S6KY_hL_iFI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/ZYurFlrfuT0/s200/070504-piggybank.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450086716079573074" /><br /><br />If you're in the United States, you know that this image represents more than just a pig. Culturally, it's much more than that. It's an icon that we associate with financial prudence, of socking away money for retirement or a rainy day. They're used as teaching devices to solidify the concept of saving to children. Banks and financial institutions use them to promote products or services that are designed to help consumers manage their money.<br /><br />Original receptacles for coins and money were made out of a type of clay called "pygg". Over time, they came to be called "pygg jars". Eventually (and probably inevitably) someone got the idea to start producing pygg jars that actually looked like pigs. And thus the symbol was born.<br /><br />The real lesson of the piggy bank is that it's value lies in its pedagogy; that is, if you want to educate children about the importance of being wise with money, you can introduce them to the piggy bank. It's communicative and cool in a way that lecturing a child would never be. It's an action, a lifestyle choice, all rolled into a single image. Simple, therefore comprehensible.<br /><br />I'm not saying we need more Smokey the Bears or Woodsie the Owls running around teaching our kids lessons, because I think those are quite different than what I'm talking about. For your own cause, can you think of a symbol you could create that would speak as simply as the piggy bank?

        I've got my mind set on buying a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iRobot-560-Roomba-Vacuuming-Silver/dp/B000UUBCNO/">Roomba</a>. I'm not in any hurry, and so far, I haven't felt the urge to spend a few hundred dollars on one of these little vacuum cleaners, but one day, I plan to get one. And I'll tell you why.<br /><br />The first time I ever saw one was in an episode of the TV Show "Arrested Development". The mother on the show is explaining that she had to get rid of their housekeeper, but mentions that she's already found a "replacement". The camera pans down to the floor and a Roomba emerges from behind the couch next to her.<br /><br />I thought this was hilarious. I was even more shocked to discover that the little robot vacuum cleaner I saw in the episode was a <em>real</em> product, and I immediately wanted one. Practicality and novelty, all rolled into one.<br /><br />There's also an <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/clips/woomba/229062/">SNL skit</a> parodying the same product, called the "woomba", which is affectionately referred to as the "little robot that cleans your noonie".<br /><br />You can debate about whether iRobot, the company responsible for creating the Roomba, paid to have the product placed into "Arrested Development" or SNL, but I wouldn't be surprised either way. In both cases, the product itself was the butt of the joke. It wasn't just a can of Coke that one of the actors was holding while telling a joke, which is, in some subliminal way, supposed to make viewers want to drink code.<br /><br />It's the kind of product that <em>deserves</em> placement in television programming. The engineers and designers who created the Roomba worked hard to make it a good conversation piece, as well as a decent vacuum cleaner. The marketing is built right in. These are the kinds of products companies should be producing, instead of the same old junk that's given a massive advertising budget which is supposed to make up for any lack of innovation.

        Just over a hundred years ago, Francis Galton set out to prove that the majority of people are stupid. He devised a very simple experiment: take an ox into a public place and have lots of random people guess at how many pounds the ox weighed. He hypothesized that a few intelligent people would get close to the correct answer, but that the majority of people would be way off the mark.<br /><br />Francis Galton was the scientist who, among lots of other things, started the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics">eugenics</a> movement. He held a worldview that believed intelligence among human beings was not only quantifiable in nature but that it was widely stratified among the human population. That is, in any population, he believed there were a few intelligent people amongst a lot of dummies.<br /><br />The results of his experiment weren't quite was he expected. When he took the average of all the guesses that people had made and compared it to the actual weight of the ox, he found that the average of all the guesses was off by only a single pound.<br /><br />What Galton had stumbled across was the tip of a much larger iceberg. The concept was explored more recently in a book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706/">The Wisdom of the Crowds</a></em>. According to the book, the results of Galton's experiment was not an isolated, freak occurrence.  The book details several examples where the knowledge of lots of people was aggregated and found to be startlingly accurate.<br /><br />The most surprising example is what happened after the <em>Challenger</em> exploded in the 1980's. Six months after the explosion and an exhaustive investigation into its causes, NASA concluded that a defective o-ring produced by a company named Morton Thiokol had caused the explosion. <br /><br />Here's where it gets spooky: right after the explosion occurred, day traders and the stock exchange reacted immediately, knowing that the companies producing parts for NASA's space shuttles would fall in response to the accident. So, a massive selloff occurred. Guess which company was hit the hardest from a fall in its stock price's valuation? Morton Thiokol.<br /><br />Of course, if you had asked any single stock broker or day trader who they thought was responsible for the accident, they wouldn't have been able to tell you. But the fact that the stock market was in place allowed the judgment of lots of people to be aggregated in centralized place and a general consensus to bubble to the surface.<br /><br />The book has implications that reach far and wide, but the most important lesson I took away from the book had nothing to do with politics, economics, or the social sciences. The general idea in the book is summarized very well in the following excerpt:<br /><br />"Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them. Groups do not need to be dominated by exceptionally intelligent people in order to be smart. Even if most people within a group are not especially well-informed or rational, it can still reach a collectively wise decision."<br /><br />In case you dozed off while skimming that paragraph, the important part is the first sentence: groups "are often smarter than the smartest people in them."<br /><br />For me, accepting this conclusion was a perfect lesson in humility. When I'm in a group of people, my ego often tricks me into thinking that I'm smarter than everyone else. So when it comes time to decide on a course of action, my head convinces me I should strongly argue my opinion with anyone else who disagrees with me. The implication of the "wisdom of the crowds" concept is that if you're trying to reach the correct or best solution to a problem, the answer doesn't lie in ensuring that the smartest person in the group makes all the decisions. Instead, it lies in reaching a consensus among those in the group.<br /><br />Cooperation is the key to making the right choice, not domination. It's not the first time I've ever heard that lesson. Socrates said that true wisdom lies in knowing that you know nothing. Insightful and wise advice, but a difficult lesson to teach with a single maxim.<br /><br />If you're trying to prove you're smarter than everyone else, than maybe you <em>should</em> be telling everyone else they're wrong. (Although I don't think that works either.) If your goal is to reach the best possible conclusion, to get something done, to make things happen in the most efficient way, than you should be working to make the group arrive at a consensus. <br /><br />In most cases, the most difficult part of leveraging the wisdom of the crowds is aggregation. Sure, it works when you're guessing something with a fixed numerical value, like the weight of an ox. But what about the strategy that your company or organization should take next? That brings to mind a conference table surrounded by people spewing their opinions, seemingly without listening to one another. It's hard to get a consensus out of that mess.<br /><br />That's what a leader should be able to do. I don't think the best leaders are the most intelligent people among us. I posit that <em>the best leaders are aggregators</em>. They can take the opinions of many, dredge them together, and find the wisdom hidden in them. It's the difficulty of this task that makes it so valuable and so sorely needed. And it's something that almost anyone, smart or dumb, is capable of doing.<br /><br />(By the way, if you haven't already, I recommend you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706/">buy the book now</a>. It's a good read.)

      <div class="content">
        There was an episode of Penn and Teller's "Bullshit!" (which is a kind of quasi-political "Mythbusters" hosted by two libertarians) where people were sent with clipboards into a big outdoor event filled with environmentalists. They carried with them a petition to ban "dihydrogen monoxide" from our nation's lakes, reservoirs, and water supply. Dihydrogen monoxide being, of course, just ordinary water. (H<sub>2</sub>O)<br /><br />They didn't lie about where dihydrogen monoxide could be found. They just told people it was a chemical compound that was everywhere, that people drank, bathed in, and that farmers put on crops. Penn and Teller's agents wielding these petitions got hundreds of people to sign the petition.<br /><br />The point? According to Penn, he said it was to demonstrate that maybe environmentalists are not so much environmentalists so much as they are "joiners...of anything."<br /><br />This was a cute stunt, and it does make a good case that a lot of environmental organizations might be full of people who are just being herded around. But here's my question: is this a problem that strikes you as being specific to people in environmental groups?<br /><br />The problem here is not that the hundreds of environmentalist signed the petition; the problem is that <em>the majority of them didn't question it!</em> To be fair, Penn and Teller point this out in the middle of that episode, stating flat out that if you don't question what you get involved in, then you run the risk of letting someone use you and your support for their own selfish ends.<br /><br />It's difficult to teach curiosity, and it's difficult to voice concern in a large group of people all moving the same direction. But again: scarcity creates value. Doing what no one else is doing often has its merits.
