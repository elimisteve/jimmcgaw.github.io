                      For the last year and half, I've been reading lots of self-help books. In terms of developing a much better understanding of who I am and what is important to me, this has been immensely helpful. On the other hand, in exploring the genre, I've definitely developed a much better sense of why people don't like these kinds of books.The titles in the section about "success" would be enough to turn me away from the...

                      I interviewed at a tech company a few months ago for a software engineering job. It was a larger organization, with an impressive campus located right on the Pacific Ocean. There were gorgeous views of the water from just about every vantage point in the sizable two buildings they occupied.As I was getting the tour, my guide was rattling off all of the perks that came with employment: a gym onsite, self-evident proximity to the...

                      About a month ago, I wrote about a difficult set of experiences I had gone through recently; I alluded to the fact that this had shattered my sense of self. Specifically, I wrote that "the cloak of self-deception I had wrapped myself in fell away".

                      In the film Almost Famous, Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays a fictionalized version of the American music journalist Lester Bangs. The film centers on a teenaged kid traveling with a popular rock band, and he's an aspiring music journalist himself. Towards the end of the film, Bangs' character is giving his protégé some advice, hoping to give him context for a problem he's facing.In his monologue, he offers, "We are uncool. Women will always be a...

                      Jesus&nbsp;was Jewish, and during the era in which he lived, the center of the Jewish world was the Temple in Jerusalem where the Jews went to worship. The Jews had lived there for almost a thousand years, without too&nbsp;much hassle from their neighbors. The original Temple built by Solomon was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. and most of the population of the city was killed. The Temple was later rebuilt.&nbsp;A couple hundred years...

                      A few days ago I was having a conversation about the process of selling a house. I'm not a homeowner, but I was curious: if you're going to make cosmetic improvements before putting it on the market, in the hopes you can get a higher selling price, where does it make the most sense to invest?
