        For the last year and half, I've been reading lots of self-help books. In terms of developing a much better understanding of who I am and what is important to me, this has been immensely helpful. On the other hand, in exploring the genre, I've definitely developed a much better sense of why people don't like these kinds of books.<div><br /></div><div>The titles in the section about "success" would be enough to turn me away from the shelves entirely. It would seem that, as a culture, we're preoccupied with growing rich without having to expend any effort to do so. Whether it's about money or otherwise, it would seem that many of the titles suggest that people are looking for quick solutions to more deep-seated problems.</div><div><br /></div><div>The books that horrify me are the ones with titles like <i>How To Make Anyone Like You</i>. Admittedly, I've never actually picked up one of these books, but I refuse to touch anything with a title that indicates that somebody needs to be disingenuous in order to get what they want. I was once scanning one about how to conduct yourself at social or business networking events; one piece of advice to use as an icebreaker was, quite literally, to walk up to a group of people you didn't know and pretend like you recognized someone in the group, then to play it off as, "Oh, sorry, I thought you were someone else." I hope I never get so lonely that I'm desperate enough to be dishonest.</div><div><br /></div><div>After my girlfriend and I split in the middle of last year, I cautiously approached the books in the relationships sub-genre of self-help, in an effort to figure out who I was relative to the dating world at large. There's no shortage of these titles in that section either: <i>How To Make Anyone Fall In Love With You</i>, <i>How To Have Him At Hello</i>, and so on. Titles like <i>The Game</i>&nbsp;reminded me that I was re-entering the dating world at a time after the Internet had given rise to the loathsome subculture of the Pickup Artist.</div><div><br /></div><div>In truth, I cannot stand a fair portion of self-help titles because they seem geared towards helping a person get what they want. Desperate to indulge yourself? Many books offer tactics on the route to getting the indulgences. I'd like to imagine a world of self-help books that shows people how to help others. Don't focus on getting what you want; focus on helping others get whatever it is they want. This is the world I want to live in, rather than a world of smiley glad-hands with faux grins trying to figure out how to manipulate me to get what they want out of me.</div><div><br /></div>All truly beneficial self-help rises and falls on an accurate basis of self-understanding. In fairness to the genre, almost all of the books that stick around for the long-term embody this quality. Here's a piece of advice that gets kicked around<span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"> between the books quite frequently; it originally came from a man named John Bunyan, and it's suggested as a remedy for those days when you're suffering from the blues: "You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you."&nbsp;</span>

        "The ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live." -Dietrich Bonhoeffer<br /><br />---<br /><br />Reality is not perfect. I doubt I'm going to get any opposition from anybody on that point. One only need to turn on the news to learn about the difficulties being faced by people everywhere. Chances are good that anyone reading this is, at this very moment, facing some personal difficulty.<br /><br />Let's call out one implicit assumption: that a perfect reality is one in which there is no difficulty. A perfect life should be&nbsp;<i>easy</i>&nbsp;for everyone in this world.<br /><br />People who are religious, and those who despise religion, both agree that reality is flawed; namely, they both accept that suffering exists. What is the difference between them? People of faith point to humankind as the flawed creature who creates his own suffering in this world; it is disconnection from God that causes it. People who oppose faith in God usually do so because they cannot accept that a God who is benevolent would allow this kind of suffering to occur. They either believe in God but despise him since he will not intervene to prevent suffering, or they reject the very notion of God because they cannot believe that, if he existed, he would refuse to intervene.<br /><br />The existence of suffering in this world does nothing to either make a case for or against God. The individual's response to suffering, and how they choose to view God, does nothing to establish truth but only offers a glimpse into the mind of that individual.<br /><br />Both the believer and the unbeliever I described above (this doesn't encompass all people) accept that reality is imperfect. Both of them find a way to justify either their belief or unbelief based on these imperfections. The believer blames humankind, shuns them, and turns to God; the unbeliever blames God, shuns him, and turns to the world.<br /><br />It is the very act of blaming that has the potential to destroy either individual. You can use either perspective on the world to justify inaction. If you blame humankind and turn to God, then you will do nothing to try and overcome the imperfections of the world, since it is the will of God. You resign yourself to believing that humans, as the source of suffering and disconnected from God by the Fall, simply cannot be helped. If you blame God, then you are all the more powerless; suffering is the will of God. If you reject the notion of God altogether on the premise that suffering exists, you are on some intellectual level still placing blame on God, and still accept the notion that human beings are helpless.<br /><br />To believe or disbelieve properly is to see the world as it is and accept it precisely as it exists, not to make judgments of it based on some hypothetical alternative you've constructed in your mind. And yet, these judgments must be made in order for us to envision what we would consider a perfect world. You must judge to see a logical endpoint, before you can start building a bridge from where the world is to the better world you believe is possible.&nbsp;We must judge both the world and ourselves accurately. To realize yourself as fully human, either as a child of God or as a child of the world, is to judge that the world is imperfect against our own vision, and judge that you are not powerless to help move the world towards a less imperfect state.

        This is a line that parents tell their children when they've received something. It's their way of gently reminding the child that when someone does something for you, you should thank them for it.<br /><br />I hear people ask the question: what happened to good customer service? You'd get the impression from people asking the question that if you were to walk into any business, you wouldn't find a single employee who treats the customers with any respect.<br /><br />I've been observing these interactions for several years now. If you're waiting in line to check out in a store, I find that keeping a keen eye on the people who are interacting with the cashiers around you, and taking the temperature of each interaction, is a good way of killing time.<br /><br />Sometimes these interactions are friendly. If they're not both smiling and chatting with each other, then at least you get the sense that they're each operating with a sense of mutual respect. It's with surprising frequency that you find a situation in which it appears that either the customer or the employee is being cold to the other. In my anecdotal experience, the blame for this is usually on the customer, who has their nose stuck down in their cellphone, barely making eye contact as the employee conducts the transaction. Or the customer stares off in the distance, preoccupied with something they're weighing in their minds, detachedly responding to the employee's questions.<br /><br />I get the sense that you'd have to have nerves of steel, to be completely impervious to being socially shunned, in order to keep a cheerful attitude as an employee in any retail environment or service business. It seems that you have to be equipped to deal with a stream of customers who aren't even polite enough to acknowledge you as another person.<br /><br />What happened to good customer service? I'd like to know what happened to the courteous customer.

        I interviewed at a tech company a few months ago for a software engineering job. It was a larger organization, with an impressive campus located right on the Pacific Ocean. There were gorgeous views of the water from just about every vantage point in the sizable two buildings they occupied.<br /><br />As I was getting the tour, my guide was rattling off all of the perks that came with employment: a gym onsite, self-evident proximity to the ocean for the surfing-inclined, a steady supply of coffee and food, and so on. She was incredibly preceptive, so she concluded by asking me, "But I wouldn't guess that all of those extras matter a whole lot to you, do they?"<br /><br />I smiled. "They're definitely not a deciding factor for me," I offered, "but who doesn't like constant sugar and caffeine on-demand?"<br /><br />I have to qualify what I'm about to say by first admitting that I've never founded a tech company. I don't know what kinds of challenges are involved in growing an organization and attracting the correct kind of talent in order to realize your vision. I completely understand that a company that offers these things is more appealing to workers than a similar one does the road that does not.<br /><br />Indeed, this is something companies do: they compete for employees via their perks. They'll put in ping-pong tables, bring in yoga instructors or other trainers, barbers, catered lunches; some have in-house daycare centers. There was even a company I knew of that built a pub named after their CTO in their basement, with a constant flow of beers on tap from kegs purchased from a local brewery.<br /><br />I can certainly say from my own work experience, as an employee, that having these perks around for your staff doesn't hurt morale. One of my non-tech friends joked about this culture, saying that you could just be drunk at your computer all day while the company babysits your kids. It comes as a surprise to many people outside of tech (heck, it surprises <i>me</i>) that there's almost no abuse of these things.<br /><br />It's good that these things are provided, because it offers a platform on which a company culture can flourish. Employees have places where they interact with the other people at the company, even those outside their own department, and can bond over things that don't involve work. And considering that the cost of these extras is typically negligible compared to the sum total they're paying their employees in salaries and benefits, it's not something that the bean counters should balk at.<br /><br />I'd start to get concerned when these things become the one of key focuses of recruiting efforts. Appeals to self-interest invariably attract the wrong kind of follower. It does make it easier to draw people into your company if you use bells and whistles, but when it inevitably happens, what is the general reaction from them when the company falls on hard times?<br /><br />When I sign on to work at any company, I accept that the overall mission of the company isn't going to be an easy one; the private sector doesn't cut anyone any slack. If you have the option, I'd choose a company based on its mission and how well that aligns with your own personal goals. Better yet, I'd like to know how all the people that work there feel about how well the work they're doing is in line with the company goals overall. All those little extra perks are wooden nickels.

        About a month ago, I wrote about a difficult set of experiences I had gone through recently; I alluded to the fact that this had shattered my sense of self. Specifically, I wrote that "the cloak of self-deception I had wrapped myself in fell away". This is pretty cryptic; what exactly did I mean by this?<br /><br />There's a common story told about the founder of the Buddhist movement. Before he became the Buddha, he was a wealthy prince named Siddhartha Gautama. When he was born, it was predicted by soothsayers that he would be a prophet who would live a meager lifestyle and bring enlightenment to many people. Siddhartha's father was alarmed by this, so he built a large, exquisite palace full of anything his son could possibly want and servants to cater to his every need. He wanted to shield him from the fate that the fortune tellers foresaw.<br /><br />When he was about 30 years old, the gods decided to intervene, and sent an old man, a sick person, and a corpse into the palace where Siddhartha lived. Prior to this, he had been shielded by his extravagant lifestyle from the realities of age, disease, and death. Surprised by this exposure, Siddhartha left his palace to encounter the wide world for the first time. He was horrified by all of the suffering he saw. Resolved to learn more about the world and how to overcome all of its horrors, he left his wife and children and went out into the world to seek enlightenment.<br /><br />Most of this story, if not all of it, is almost certainly apocryphal. It's a <i>mythos</i>&nbsp;cooked up by Buddhist thinkers to illustrate that a life of luxury is a gilded cage. So many of us see the inevitable steamroller approaching us to flatten us out, so we stick our heads in the sand like ostriches. (Tangent: that's a myth; ostriches don't actually do this.) You can hide from the world, but you cannot escape the suffering common to all of humanity, and you cannot escape death.<br /><br />I entered my freshman year of college truly wanting to help people in need. I have no idea where this impulse came from; I grew up in an upper-middle class suburban city devoid of the suffering so pervasive in most of the world. When I first got to college, I bounced around campus looking for a just cause to back, and people I could join on a mission, with whom I felt a kinship. I met with environmentalists, those interested in fighting poverty around the world, and several others. I never had success. In the course of doing this, I was slowly drawn into the normal preoccupations of undergraduate life a large university, namely, I looked for a place to belong <i>socially</i>. This also proved difficult.<br /><br />Towards the end of my freshman year, I made what could probably be called the biggest mistake of my life. There was blame to be had on both sides, but I betrayed the trust of some close friends I had; the friendships dissolved. This happened because I had been trying so hard to adapt to the people around me, to be something I was not, which will always bring a soul into conflict. At the time, it very much felt like I had done what Winston did at the end of the novel <i>1984</i>, when confronted with the terrors of Room 101. In my own way, I had cried out <i>"Do it to Julia!"</i>&nbsp;and in doing so, lost my sense of moral superiority.<br /><br />In the wake of this, I abandoned myself to the forces of the world around me. I could no longer see the point of helping others, of trying to do what I felt was right, in a world that seemed filled with people who always acted out of self-interest. It seemed that altruism would only put you at hazard with the world. Trying to help only sets you up to be taken advantage of.<br /><br />My friends from college will remember that I spent hours adamantly debating that altruism doesn't exist in our world; I was trying so hard to convince myself, so I wouldn't feel bad about having left myself behind. Or I was looking for someone to prove me wrong, so I could feel justified in trying to recover myself. At the time, I felt that changing course and pursuing self-interest was bringing myself in line with my own true nature, and in doing so, I hoped this would help me avoid any further conflicts in my soul. The truth is, I was only compounding it. As Pink Floyd sang, it was all just bricks in the wall.<br /><br />So for the past 15 years, I've made a very weak, disconcerted effort to act out of self-interest. I haven't been selfish, but I have tried so hard to <i>act</i>&nbsp;like it, to realize what I think I should be. Nor have I done much to help others either. I have basically behaved exactly as I am: like a confused man who is at odds with himself.<br /><br />Following your conscience to do what you feel is right in this world is usually the correct thing to do. (Provided your conscience isn't telling you to hurt anyone else.) However, feeling the need to justify yourself for what you are doing to anyone else is <i>dangerous</i>. Any sense of moral superiority on your part over others around you is, in fact, a very real indicator of moral <i>inferiority</i>. It makes you susceptible. You must do what you feel is right from a sense of strength within yourself, with no basis of comparison to those around you. It's judgment that defeats us...and I know this because now I can recognize how quickly it defeated <i>me</i>.<br /><br />My more recent set of experiences that happened a couple of months ago broke through all of my barriers. The destruction hurt, but it let the light in. All of it gave me what I have been actively searching for for the last few years: my own personal&nbsp;<i>anagnorisis</i>.<br /><br />Most of my days as of late have been me striding out confidently into the world, much in the way Kevin McCallister did in the film <i>Home Alone</i>, yelling "I'm not afraid anymore!" Then Old Man Marley comes along, dragging his shovel and trash can of salt, and Kevin screams and runs back into the house. But increasingly, I'm having more days like the scene in the basement, where the demonic furnace Kevin fears whirs to live and taunts him; Kevin recognizes how silly it is to be afraid of such a thing, and exuding only tired boredom, simply says "Shut up."<br /><br />The most difficult thing in this world is to harmonize one's actions with oneself, not least of all because <i>knowing</i>&nbsp;oneself is the first prerequisite.

        In the film <i>Almost Famous</i>, Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays a fictionalized version of the American music journalist Lester Bangs. The film centers on a teenaged kid traveling with a popular rock band, and he's an aspiring music journalist himself. Towards the end of the film, Bangs' character is giving his protégé some advice, hoping to give him context for a problem he's facing.<br /><br />In his monologue, he offers, "We are uncool. Women will <i>always</i> be a problem for guys like us."<br /><br />This past summer, I attended a large festival in southern France. This event draws tens of thousands of people who crowd the streets of a relatively small town. I was there with a group of a few dozen people, as a lone American amidst the native French.<br /><br />One of my friends is a guy who is much better looking than I am. I can say this with complete confidence in my own heterosexuality. It's simply an objective fact I can state, without being self-deprecating. Not only are his physical features are more striking, but he carries himself with more confidence and charisma than I do.<br /><br />At this festival, I was standing amidst the dense crowd when a girl came wandering by my cluster of friends. It didn't seem she wasn't headed anywhere in particular; she was just making her way through the throng from some A to some other B. She passed by on my left. In scanning the crowd, her eyes suddenly lit upon my friend, standing a few meters to my right.<br /><br />I'll never forget the way her eyes widened and her jaw dropped. "Oh my god!" she exclaimed, and almost instinctively, she suddenly moved with purpose, making a beeline for my friend. In the process, she nudged me and the person I was talking to out of her way, so she could pass between us. It was a busy evening, and while I have no idea what happened when she approached my friend, I'd guess that he got away from her pretty quickly.<br /><br />To the best of my knowledge, no girl has ever reacted to me this way, drawn lustfully toward me based on a mere first impression. In my youth I would have felt jealous of my friend. At the time this happened, though, I felt the complete opposite of envy. I remember thinking, <i>Better him than me</i>. I had a girlfriend at the time, and while this was pretty much the only factor that drove my thoughts, I could still appreciate not having to expend any energy to identify and ward off the capricious.<br /><br />I identify with the group of guys that Lester Bangs places himself into. While I'm not a bad-looking guy (*adjusts tie*), I am uncool. But he has it completely backwards. While I understand that what he means is that getting any girl won't ever be an <i>effortless</i> process, I learned long ago that women will&nbsp;never&nbsp;be a <i>problem</i> for guys like me.

        Jesus&nbsp;was Jewish, and during the era in which he lived, the center of the Jewish world was the Temple in Jerusalem where the Jews went to worship. The Jews had lived there for almost a thousand years, without <i>too</i>&nbsp;much hassle from their neighbors. The original Temple built by Solomon was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. and most of the population of the city was killed. The Temple was later rebuilt.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>A couple hundred years afterwards, the Jews in the city narrowly averted disaster in their encounter with the Greeks. Alexander the Great came strolling through in 332 B.C.E., and the Jews showed him that his conquest of the Mecedonian world had been prophesized in their Book of Daniel. Supposedly Alexander was so delighted to see himself referenced in the Jews' holy book that he didn't conquer Jerusalem.<div><div><br /></div><div>In 63 B.C.E, the Romans seized control of Jerusalem, occupying the city with soldiers and subjecting its citizens to a tax to be paid to the Roman empire. This lasted until around 70 C.E., when Jerusalem was burned to the ground by the Romans in response to a Jewish revolt. During this 150 years, the religious rulers of the Jewish people in Jerusalem maintained an uneasy truce with the political and military leaders of their Roman overlords.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>It was in this context that the death of Jesus occurred. Crucifixion came from the Romans, and it was the preferred form of punishment for those who committed acts of treason against the Roman empire. Scripture tells us that Jesus of Nazareth was becoming a nuisance to the Pharisees, the Jewish ruling council in Jerusalem. They saw Jesus as a threat to their established power. Since Jewish law forbade murder, the Pharisees, in an effort to get rid of him, persuaded the Romans to do their dirty work for him. The Roman governor of the region at that time, Pontius Pilate, was hesitant to kill Jesus, since he didn't seem like such a bad guy, but the Pharisees were quite insistent. And so Jesus gets the nails.</div><div><br /></div><div>Again, this is the story according to <i>scripture</i>; historical accounts portray Pilate as a far less merciful individual. Was Jesus killed by the Romans for his acts of sedition or was his death prompted by his acts of heresy against the Jewish rulers? It matters little for our purposes; let's stick with the scripture version.</div><div><br /></div><div>So the New Testament, it would seem, contains a lesson about what happens when religious leaders collude with those in political power: <i>Jesus gets killed</i>. Arguably, this isn't such a bad thing; after all, Jesus was <i>supposed</i>&nbsp;to die, according to all the legends. But still, even if it did redeem all of the sins of mankind, this single instance of capital punishment is one that Christians point to as one of the most cruel acts of injustice in all of history.</div><div><br /></div><div>The moral of this story points unerringly to the importance of the doctrine of the separation of church and state. Our Pharisees (e.g. Christian leaders) and our Romans (e.g. those people on Capitol Hill) should <i>not</i> be consorting with one another. Otherwise,&nbsp;<i>Jesus dies</i>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The church, like any church in the United States, should seek to lobby those in Congress about political matters, but no church should seek political power, nor should those in politics yield it to them for any reason. I don't see any problem with politicians choosing to practice any particular religion, provided it doesn't cause them to ignore the lobbying of those who belong to other faiths.</div><div><br /></div><div>All members of a church should be allowed to vote, like in any healthy democracy; I have no strong opinion about religious leaders encouraging the members of their congregations to vote this way or that way. I'd ask that all members of any religion, while voting, choose to vote their own conscience. I do have a strong opinion, which is to say a strong <i>aversion</i>, to any church member whose voting preferences are all perfectly identical to what their religious leader has told them, unless this happens to be a coincidence.</div><div><br /></div><div>(To those in the U.S.: happy tax day.)</div>

        "The slave seeks only to be free, but he does not hope to acquire the estate of his master." -<a href="http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html" target="_blank">The Gospel of Philip</a> (a non-canonical Christian gospel)<br /><br />I'm currently reading <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-U-S-Feminisms-Rory-Dicker/dp/1580055885/" target="_blank">A History of U.S. Feminisms</a></i>, by Rory Dicker, which is a short introduction to feminist movement in the last 200 years, broken up into the three waves. It's one of the best and most approachable books I've found for anyone coming to the subject matter for the first time. I might have more to say about the book later, but I want to merely make a simple point here.<br /><br />From this book, I learned that it was Rush Limbaugh who popularized the term "feminazi". It's never been lost on me that feminists in popular culture are often painted with broad strokes in an unfavorable tint. They're made out to be aggressive and self-seeking individuals who seek not only women's equality, but to tip the scales so that women have more rights than men.<br /><br />The message is as pernicious as it is subtle: men should oppose the advancement of women having equal rights lest they find themselves overtaken by them. Men unite! We must defend the patriarchy, lest it become the matriarchy and we find ourselves subjugated by it. This takes a very dim view of human nature, and one that has been prevalent in our society since Hobbes penned <i>The Leviathan</i>.<br /><br />I've recognized that this is what we're supposed to learn from the stereotype of the feminist. The oppressed begrudge the oppressor, and thus desire to become the oppressor. But if we accept this lesson (as men), aren't we conceding the simple fact that oppression is, in fact, now occurring? Why don't our consciences convict us? Pundits who would encourage men to accept this argument and resist the advances of the feminist movement are implying that men should remain oppressors; as a man, are you okay with passively accepting this identity?

        A few days ago I was having a conversation about the process of selling a house. I'm not a homeowner, but I was curious: if you're going to make cosmetic improvements before putting it on the market, in the hopes you can get a higher selling price, where does it make the most sense to invest? (While it depends on the property, the general answer is kitchen and bathrooms.)<br /><br />The discussion came around to those little things you can do. Before a prospective buyer shows up to walk through the house, bake cookies and get the smell of sugary goodness wafting through the air. Set the kitchen table as though you were about to sit down to eat. Clean up any messes or clutter you have lying around. These kinds of things make a home seem more inviting. No two houses are the same, but to the extent you could test this kind of thing, use of these types of tactics appear to be correlated with a higher closing price.<br /><br />Isn't this manipulative? Of course it is, but it's not dishonest. It would be wrong to lie about, or to conceal, some problem with a house you're selling, but putting out some fresh-baked cookies is a pretty transparent way of influencing a prospective buyer. If they feel slighted because they're being manipulated, they have the option of turning around and walking out without buying your house.<br /><br />I'm not interested in the ethics of cookie baking to sell a house for more money. What interests me is that some people have an awareness of these tactics when they encounter them, and others do not. Some people would come in, smell the cookie smell, and not give a second thought to it. It wouldn't even cross their minds that the cookies had been baked with the intent of making them want the house more. This is probably most people; if you're shopping around for a house, I would think you'd have a lot more on your mind to focus on than the reason the owner is <i>baking some confections</i> to coincide with your visit.<br /><br />So who's more susceptible to these tactics? Someone who knows about them and consciously takes notice when they encounter them, or someone who doesn't know about them and remains happily oblivious? Are most people who I call "oblivious" actually oblivious, or are they merely processing the knowledge on a different, sensory level that's below conscious awareness?<br /><br />I read recently about a study that psychologists did in this area, as it pertains to advertising. If you're aware of the tactics being used, and you're aware that you're susceptible to them, are you more or less likely to succumb to them? Counterintuitively, the result of the study showed that people who were aware were more likely to succumb than those who were not. Why is this? Does this awareness make us let our guard down? Does it cause the thing to which we're being exposed to get embedded deeper in our brains? <i>Why am I asking myself all these questions?</i><br /><br />I can't remember how this study was constructed, and unfortunately, I don't remember where I read about it, so I can't offer a link with more details. I also can't be sure if this translates to the home selling example I mentioned before. But I thought the idea was interesting enough. In some contexts, knowledge of our weaknesses and how they might be used to influence us makes us <i>more</i>&nbsp;susceptible to being influenced instead of less. Knowledge doesn't always inoculate us. Maybe, then, we shouldn't study advertising tactics as a means of self-defense.
