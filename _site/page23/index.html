        Two ways you can demonstrate know-how on a job interview when someone asks you a question about how you would solve a problem:<br /><br />1. You can quickly offer up the first answer that pops into your head.<br /><br />2. Ask any important clarifying questions related to the problem, then offer your solution.<br /><br />In my experience, people who are truly masters of their own domain are inclined more towards the second approach. It's naive to jump right to the assumption that you fully understand the problem right away. Much better to use the divide-and-conquer strategy, and figure out exactly where the problem lies.

        I was at a wedding last August. Most of the people I knew there were from high school. I had a pretty good time catching up with everyone, but it was pretty standard: people talked about their jobs, the good and bad. I was happy to hear way more good news from people than bad.<br /><br />Later in the evening, I ran into one friend and met his wife. She mentioned to me that she had been laid off from her job a few months before; she wasn't the first person that evening who had told me that. But as I was offering her my consolation nod, she added, "But right now, I'm using the extra time to start my own business."<br /><br />I got really excited by this. After several hours of polite, idle chatter, I was delighted to have found someone who seemed to have the drive and initiative to try to make her own path and carve out a path for herself. I told her flat out that I thought it was terrific that she was taking the risks, and I spewed all of the encouragement I could at her. It probably came across as disingenuous...but I really couldn't help it.<br /><br />I'm always interested where the entrepreneurial spark comes when I see it in people. In my experience, it certainly doesn't seem like a product of the education system--public or private. It's not something that's suggested or encouraged as a potential career path as a matter of course. In our society, it's perceived as a subversive route to take in life.<br /><br />The gumption to go out and create a business is a rare trait. It doesn't need a devil's advocate or a reality check. It needs encouragement.

        I got started playing the game "Angry Birds" yesterday. I downloaded it initially out of curiosity and, like so many popular things, I stuck around for a while because I was trying to figure out why exactly <em>why</em> it was so popular. It's not a bad game...it's a time suck, but well worth the $1 it cost me.<br /><br />The reason it's popular, I think, is because it's <em>easy</em>.<br /><br />I'm not saying the game is without any challenges at all, but it doesn't take a whole lot of talent. You can figure things out in under a minute, and after nail the finesse of launching the birds, most of the game is luck. And so the game itself just becomes a habit.<br /><br />It made me reflect on other things in my life. Projects I've undertaken, people I've known, stuff I've started, and so on. A lot of those things are like "Angry Birds"...they're easy to keep doing because they're what I've always done, and it's easier to keep doing them, out of habit, than it is to seek out new things.<br /><br />Not all habits are bad. But more importantly, it's not just the bad ones that need breaking.

        I swear allegiance to very little in this world.<br /><br />I've spent enough time in the company of people who seem caught up in something they believe in to want to avoid falling into that trap myself. Some people really, really love Apple products, for example. I don't dislike Apple products, but I'm not, as they say, going to drink the Kool-Aid. It really didn't matter if tomorrow I got a job working at Apple. I'm sure they're a great company to work for, I'm sure they've got great design, I'm sure that they do a great job of staying ahead of the curve. In my book, it doesn't matter.<br /><br />It's a matter of keeping perspective. As soon as you've downed the Kool-Aid, you don't get to be objective anymore. Your take on things becomes fractured, and your own perception of things can become warped around the way you <em>want</em> things to be, instead of the way they actually are.<br /><br />But here's the thing: I'm pretty sure I'm wrong about this. First, I've drunken someone's Kool-Aid...I'm just not aware of whose it is, and I'm not aware that I've consumed it because, well, I've consumed it. So it goes.<br /><br />More importantly, there ain't no great work without passion, and passion is born of the kind of zeal that comes with believing in something almost blindly. Keeping perspective is important, but trying to maintain complete, total, and boring objectivity is probably just a different way of warping your perspective.<br /><br />You are the hero in your own story. You just have to choose how to steer the plot before you die. It's either that, or let someone else do it for you.

        Technology is a medium. It's a vector through which ideas can spread.<br /><br />For the last few hundred years, this has been the role of technology. Self-interest has driven its uprise, supported by people driven to share something with others. First it was books, then the telegraph, then the radio, television, and then the Internet.<br /><br />This has led to a great democratization of information. The same information is available to almost everyone, on a scale that's unprecedented in the history of the world. <br /><br />And yet, we're not all the same. We believe different things. We're all infected with different things.<br /><br />For a few years, I thought conformity was a prevalent problem in the American culture. I embraced this idea largely because it was a trendy thing to do at the time. But for the last decade or so, I've never thought that conformity was a problem. People, even those who share a lot of the same qualities, are still radically different from one another.<br /><br />The difference is not in the information we receive, but in our world view. This is the filter that determines what information sticks to our brains and what falls through the cracks. Asking people to change their minds about certain things, just through the use of facts, is more often than not an exercise in futility, because people decide based on emotion, then seek out facts to support the decision.<br /><br />And yet, there are many things that seemed futile at the beginning but proved worthwhile in hindsight. It was "futile" to get people to stop littering, stop drinking and driving, and start sorting their trash into recycling bins. Or to get people paying $4 for a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Hitler once said that the bigger the lie, the more people would believe it. Maybe the more futile the goal, the better chance you have at succeeding through persistence.

        In the world of inventors, "innovation" is the key term. The assembly line was an innovation that transformed the automobile industry. The Internet, a distributed network of computers spitting hypertext documents at one another, was a massive innovation in telecommunications.<br /><br />Big jumps aside, a lot of innovations don't really happen by completely inventing or reinventing an entire new system or infrastructure. They happen by tweaking what already exists. DVD players were a whole different kind of technology, but the players themselves looked just like thinner version of VCRs, and their media recorded on the same material as audio CDs. A complete innovation in coffee would happen if the majority of coffee drinkers stopped drinking coffee and started drinking something else. <br /><br />What we should really be looking for is not the new and daring, but the obvious. It's the thing that, when we see it, we slap ourselves in the forehead and say, "Duh! Why didn't I think of that?" The comment belies something that we know on a lower level, but of which we're not fully aware. It those corners of our mind that we glean over because we're taking what's hiding in them for granted.<br /><br />This might sound like simple advice, but it isn't, because finding the obvious is one of the most difficult things to do. But there's usually a bigger market for the obvious than the truly, radically innovative.

        There are some days I just can't just any reading done.<br /><br />Usually, these are the days when I've committed myself to reading something that I'm about a third of the way through, but I just can't concentrate and bring myself to pick up the damn book long enough to get anywhere. Or I end up staring through the same page for about 15 minutes. <br /><br />I used to feel bad about this, and force myself, as a matter of discipline, to finish one book before I started reading another. I no longer feel bad about that...if a book doesn't stick to my brain, after so long, I let it go.<br /><br />I read recently that some of the more modern philosophers and scholars, like John Locke and Francis Bacon, used to read several books all at once. Not simultaneously, mind you, but they jumped around from book to book. And to them, writing was indistinguishable from reading. As they plowed through each book, they would jot down notes in a journal, as a means of tracking and documenting their own ideas. <br /><br />It was a practice known as <em>commonplacing</em>. The biggest benefit that comes out of this kind of jumbled approach to knowledge intake is that it's a means of chasing serendipity. Innovative ideas, in my experience, are born not of experts focusing hard in one area, but in random collisions that happen across different disciplines.<br /><br />Commonplacing makes a good deal of sense to me, largely because this blog is me documenting my own internal responses to ideas or thoughts that I pull from blogs or books. Chances are good that on the average day, you're taking in a lot of input, and you probably have your own thoughts about what you read. <br /><br />Why not start sharing it?

        In conversation there are a few different kinds of things people can talk about. Ranking them from least useful (and most annoying) to more constructive:<br /><br />1. Gossip about celebrities.<br />2. Gossip about other people.<br />3. Expounding on bad things from the past.<br />4. Expounding on bad things in the present.<br />5. Dwelling on anxiety about the future.<br />6. Discussing the past as it applies to the present.<br />7. Discussing the past as it applies to the future.<br />8. Discussing the present as it applies to the future.<br />9. Discussing what great things the future could hold.<br /><br />Not all conversation is created equal. And all conversation is trumped by any action that carries you forward along the lines of #9.

        Someone asked Jimmy Wales about the neutrality of any given Wikipedia article. Historically, <em>neutrality</em> is a loaded term that has been debated about at length, as a philosophical concept. What makes an idea neutral? Can an idea be neutral, given that any thought or idea is invariably born of at least (or at most) one human mind?<br /><br />Wales was dismissive of the question, saying that philosophical debates really didn't interest him. He went on further to say that a Wikipedia article is "neutral" as soon as people stop editing it.<br /><br />This is simple enough: anyone can edit a Wikipedia entry, so as articles get refined over time, any ambiguities in language that leave room for dispute are ironed out of the content. Neutrality, then, becomes something that happens in a social context, when no one feels obliged to voice protest.<br /><br />Even then, there's no such thing as something purely neutral. It's more of a quiet truce than it is agreement. And yesterday's neutral often becomes the catalyst of tomorrow's revolution.

        In the movie <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, the actor from the film's title enters a portal into his own head. As a result, Malkovich ends up in a fantastical world where every man, woman, and child has his head, and the only thing anyone can say is "Malkovich" over and over again.<br /><br />As funny or horrifying as this is, I know lots of people who seem to think that the world could be made a better place if everyone were more like them. Here's the mentality: if only everyone decided to vote/went to the same church/listened to the same music/ate the same food as me, things would be better. If only.<br /><br />When you say it like that, it sounds silly. It's unrealistic. But most people don't say it...they just <em>think</em> it.<br /><br />I rarely recommend specific book titles to other people. This is largely because our experiences are subjective. The books that have enlightened me and opened my eyes to new things are not necessarily going to have the same impact on every else that I know.<br /><br />But, when I do offer a book recommendation, it's not because I'm interested in getting the other person to start thinking more like me. I offer book recommendations not to reinforce similarities in thinking, but to recommend a place where I think their brain will be free to run wild on its own terms. I usually hope the conclusions they reach are different than my own.<br /><br />I don't see a world full of people like me being markedly better than the way it is now. Like most human beings, I have my strengths and weaknesses, most of which exist in a social context relative to those around me. We are people because of other people, and that's based more on our differences than our similarities. <br /><br />Diversity is something to be celebrated, not feared or eliminated.
