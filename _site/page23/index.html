                      Let's say you have a large set of truly random, widely distributed numbers. What portion of them, if you counted it up, would start with the digit 1? How about 2? 3? Most people intuitively say it's 1 in 9, an equal share of probability, for each one. In reality, this isn't what ends up happening. In a large random sampling of numbers, each has roughly a 30% chance of starting with 1. (Or, another...

                      Two ways you can demonstrate know-how on a job interview when someone asks you a question about how you would solve a problem:1. You can quickly offer up the first answer that pops into your head.2. Ask any important clarifying questions related to the problem, then offer your solution.In my experience, people who are truly masters of their own domain are inclined more towards the second approach. It's naive to jump right to the assumption...

                      I was at a wedding last August. Most of the people I knew there were from high school. I had a pretty good time catching up with everyone, but it was pretty standard: people talked about their jobs, the good and bad. I was happy to hear way more good news from people than bad.Later in the evening, I ran into one friend and met his wife. She mentioned to me that she had been...

                      I got started playing the game "Angry Birds" yesterday. I downloaded it initially out of curiosity and, like so many popular things, I stuck around for a while because I was trying to figure out why exactly why it was so popular. It's not a bad game...it's a time suck, but well worth the $1 it cost me.The reason it's popular, I think, is because it's easy.I'm not saying the game is without any challenges...

                      I swear allegiance to very little in this world.I've spent enough time in the company of people who seem caught up in something they believe in to want to avoid falling into that trap myself. Some people really, really love Apple products, for example. I don't dislike Apple products, but I'm not, as they say, going to drink the Kool-Aid. It really didn't matter if tomorrow I got a job working at Apple. I'm sure...

                      Technology is a medium. It's a vector through which ideas can spread.For the last few hundred years, this has been the role of technology. Self-interest has driven its uprise, supported by people driven to share something with others. First it was books, then the telegraph, then the radio, television, and then the Internet.This has led to a great democratization of information. The same information is available to almost everyone, on a scale that's unprecedented in...

                      In the world of inventors, "innovation" is the key term. The assembly line was an innovation that transformed the automobile industry. The Internet, a distributed network of computers spitting hypertext documents at one another, was a massive innovation in telecommunications.Big jumps aside, a lot of innovations don't really happen by completely inventing or reinventing an entire new system or infrastructure.

                      There are some days I just can't just any reading done.Usually, these are the days when I've committed myself to reading something that I'm about a third of the way through, but I just can't concentrate and bring myself to pick up the damn book long enough to get anywhere.

                      Someone asked Jimmy Wales about the neutrality of any given Wikipedia article. Historically, neutrality is a loaded term that has been debated about at length, as a philosophical concept. What makes an idea neutral?
