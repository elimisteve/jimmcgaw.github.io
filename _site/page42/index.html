        If you're a recovering alcoholic, it can be easy to talk yourself into one drink (or two) with friends at bar one night.<br /><br />If you're self-employed, you have the luxury of being able to take an afternoon off during a workday to go hang out on the beach, if you so choose.<br /><br />If you resolve to save money by brewing your coffee at home and taking it to work, it can be easy to skip it one morning and pay the $2 at Starbucks for your coffee instead.<br /><br />The problem with making these kinds of exceptions is that we're creatures of habit. If you do something once, it's all that much easier to do it the next time, and even easier the time after that, and so on. It's very easy for these one-time acts to become recurring ones.<br /><br />Where can you use this to your advantage? In overcoming fear, I think. Last night, I went hiking by myself in the mountains well after dusk, into woods that are crawling with scorpions (which give me the heebie jeebies, but probably shouldn't) and rattlesnakes (which don't give me the heebie jeebies, but probably ought to.) There was a real palpable fear that grew the deeper into the woods I went, which took the form of a lump in my throat.<br /><br />But I pressed through it and managed to make it all the way to the top. Wasn't easy, but I did it. And now that I've done it once, it will (hopefully) be easier next time.<br /><br />Stay away from those bad exceptions. And push through the ones you stand to benefit from.

        In the movie <em>Thank You For Smoking</em>, tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor goes into his son's classroom to talk about what he does for a living. After talking a little bit about questioning authority, he concludes his speech with, "So perhaps instead of acting like sheep when it comes to cigarettes you should find out for yourself." At this point, the teacher politely interrupts him by starting to applaud and ushers him out of the classroom.<br /><br />It didn't offend me, but it's very easy to see how a person watching this movie might get extremely angry at a tobacco lobbyist encouraging kids to try cigarettes. It's very easy to <em>react</em>. It's easy to get into a huff, stomp around your home or office, and tell the next 12 people you see about that "idiot tobacco lobbyist".<br /><br />I suffered through all of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, and the one thing from that film that stuck with me was Marlon Brando saying, "It's judgment that defeats us." That's a nice sentiment, but it's not judgment in and of itself that's the problem...it's how we choose to express that judgment. <em>Reacting</em> is ineffective because it's emotional.<br /><br />It's much better to <em>respond</em> to things than to react to them. As Zig Ziglar was fond of saying, when the doctor gives us medicine, it's bad if our bodies react to the medicine. But if our bodies respond to the medicine, that's a positive thing.<br /><br />Reality is medicine, and it's generally a bitter pill to swallow. Do you react or do you respond?<br /><br />It would be easy to react to the scene in <em>Thank You For Smoking</em>, to get all riled up and emotionally involved. But a much more productive thing to do is to respond. Think things through. Give yourself time before you act.<br /><br />And what conclusion might you reach? Perhaps that Big Tobacco didn't get big overnight. They became a billion dollar a year industry through accretion, the slow accumulation and growing of a segment of society that smoked cigarettes. And when you recognize this, you start to realize that the same for-profit motives that drive marketing for the tobacco companies could be used to influence people the other way. The same forces of persuasion that get people to start smoking could potentially be used to get them to stop, or better yet, never start in the first place.<br /><br />I've met lots of people who have reacted angrily to the practices of Big Tobacco. But the people who conceived of and executed the <a href="http://www.thetruth.com/">Truth</a> campaign took the time to <em>respond</em>. Which of these two groups, which do you think has made the biggest positive difference in the world?

        I had one professor in college who used to take notes based on what his students were saying. I can't say for sure, but it didn't seem like he was making notes in order to refine his future lectures. Instead, he seemed he was actually making an effort to collect ideas from his students so he could reflect upon them later.<br /><br />I had lots of professors that used the Socratic method in an effort to get students talking and just run down the clock. Even at ten in the morning, this rarely worked. It was almost always preferable to have the professor drone on endlessly, instead of asking questions that none of us had any guts, incentive, or even inclination to answer.<br /><br />But one professor made a genuine effort to listen to us back, in four years of college. That was so unusual that I remember it well. And I paid a great deal of attention in that class because the lecturer made it perfectly clear that attention--and respect--were not just one-way streets.

        It's on my bucket list to drive to the house of the guy who invented the car alarm at three in the morning, bring lots of people with me, and we all hit the "panic" button that sets off our car alarms. (It's low on the list, but it's there.)<br /><br />Most websites have a system administrator, whose role is to maintain the servers that are hosting the site and make sure that if anything goes wrong, they get a notification about the problem so they can deal with it. In the era of smartphones, this is actually a very simple thing to set up. <br /><br />What surprises me is that the auto industry hasn't devised a standard way for this to be set up in place of the traditional car alarm. Instead of a loud noise blaring whenever the car senses someone broke a window, why not send an alert message to the owner of the phone letting them know someone is trying to break in? Let them get the notification so they can deal with it. No reason the rest of us within earshot need to be crowdsourced to call the police.<br /><br />"But," I hear you begin, "car alarms go off an awful lot. I don't need to be notified every time my car alarm goes off." Really? Then why do the rest of us need to care, exactly?<br /><br />I think the point of a car alarm is deterrence. If you're a car thief, and you break into a car and an alarm goes off, you flee and move on to the next car. (Or perhaps you just cut the power to the alarm...not a difficult task.) So a car alarm really says to the thief, "You can steal a car...but please don't steal <em>this one</em>." <br /><br />Fair enough...but imagine a world where car alarms are silent alert messages sent to people's mobile devices. Let's say one car in four has such an alarm on it. Since the auto thief wouldn't have any way of knowing which cars have these alarms and which don't, wouldn't that act as more of a deterrent?

        I was hiking in the mountains yesterday morning, and on my way down, I passed a guy on a bicycle who was riding up the trail. Now, riding up this trail is no small feat; it's incredibly taxing. You pedal furiously, and for every twelve pedals your feet put in, you move forward maybe 12 inches.<br /><br />When I'm up hiking during the day, I offer a friendly "Hello" to everyone I pass. Some people give a friendly reply in return and others ignore me completely. But when I pass someone who on a bicycle coming up the trail, I don't say hello to them because they're usually out of breath and fighting just to maintain enough forward momentum to keep from falling over.<br /><br />Yesterday morning, though, this fellow looked up, saw me, and belted out a boisterous and jolly, "Good morning!" I did a double take move, caught off guard by his enthusiasm.<br /><br />A friendly greeting, even in the face of the struggle. Rare, unexpected, and refreshing...three things which have the power to suddenly make our days better.

        I was discussing the joys of Quants with a friend of mine, who was ranting and raving about how speculators on Wall Street don't really do any real work. He felt that they were responsible for getting us into this whole mess, and that none of them were really being held responsible for the trouble. After a few minutes of this, he took a breath and then thoughtfully remarked, "Although, they're probably doing more important work than the vendor pushing a cart down the street selling hot dogs."<br /><br />I couldn't disagree with the latter statement more. The work of a Quant might be much more challenging than peddling hot dogs, and it certainly requires a higher education level. (Although if you took the hot dog vendor off the street and had him tackle the stock market, I think there's a good chance his performance would be comparable to that of your average speculator.)<br /><br />But the hot dog vendor is building equity in a business. He's building a brand. And out there on the street, selling something to people, he has a real opportunity to bring joy to people who are hungrily walking the streets. He (or she) can connect with customers by being a friendly person and making people happy to buy a hot dog from him. He could work hard to become part of the community.<br /><br />There's real, tangible value in that. Sure, at a few dollars per hot dog, perhaps he's not trying as hard as he could if he were selling furniture, but he does have the opportunity to give it his all and grow a real business.<br /><br />Contrast that with the stock market speculator, who is doing little more than pushing people's money around between investments, and taking a commission for himself each time he does so. Speculation, as opposed to long-term investment, in stocks is a losing strategy for everyone except the broker.<br /><br />I once heard someone say that a "professional" is someone who <em>adds</em> value to society, and not someone who extracts value from it. Given those terms, who would you say is a more respectable professional: the hot dog vendor or the speculator?

        If you're a writer and you want to publish a book, you don't just have one shot at success. That might have been true about 30 years ago when you needed the blessing of a major publishing house in order to get your book printed and distributed. When Random House finally called you back and said they wanted to publish your book, you made sure you returned their calls and showed up promptly to meet with them. If you blew it, if you didn't sell yourself to them, then you might have missed your chance. And it might have been the only one you ever got.<br /><br />They don't get to choose any longer. I met someone a couple weeks ago who has self-published a book on <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">LuLu.com</a>. For a few hundred dollars, he got himself listed on Amazon and an ISBN number. No negotiations with Jeff Bezos over the allocation of shelf space; on Amazon, shelf space is infinite. No dealing with an agent to even get your manuscript read. (And to anyone who feels that a few hundred dollars is too much to invest in your own book, well, then what are you doing trying to convince anyone else that they should invest several <em>thousand</em> dollars in your book?)<br /><br />To anyone who seeks to write a book that will change things, or the great American novel, or their memoirs: here's your chance. Right now. Life's too short to sit around waiting for someone sitting in a cubicle in some other state to validate your art by agreeing to publish it. They don't know you or your world even 10% as well as you do, so why trust their judgment?<br /><br />You can have as many chances as you need now. Seize them.

        Last time I checked out at Costco, there was a sign hanging below the register that read, "Only <em>one</em> copy of your receipt can be provided to you."<br /><br />This is a simple point, but stores don't hang up signs like that without them being a response to customer inquiries. If you see a sign that says, "No Dogs Allowed", you can bet it's because people brought their dogs in and the store owner thought, "Gee whiz, I'm gonna put a stop to this by hangin' up a sign." Each sign tells a little story from the store's past.<br /><br />So, the reason that Costco is insisting so heavily on only one receipt per order is that people started asking for multiple receipts. This hardly comes as a surprise, as Costco bills itself as a wholesaler merchant supplying goods to small businesses. Most prudent small business owners keep good records and extra copies of receipts would be useful.<br /><br />What's odd is that, in the face of this request from customers, they decided to view it as a <em>problem</em>, and decided to post a sign in order to eliminate the printing of extra receipts. No dogs allowed!<br /><br />They could have gone the other direction. Instead of refusing to print receipts, let customers get two or three. Then, set up a system online so that customers can opt-in to getting copies of their receipts emailed to their accounts each time they make a purchase. That way, customers could print as many copies as they needed for filing at home.<br /><br />Where could Costco get the money to develop this system? From the marketing budget, of course. Sacrificing a few billboards is well worth it in order to provide convenience to customers...who are probably running around trying to photocopy their one copy of a Costco receipt.

        In the film <em>What About Bob</em>, one of the characters is a psychiatrist (Richard Dreyfuss) who takes on a new patient (Bill Murray) who ends up being quite a handful. The doctor is the author of a (fictional) book called <em>Baby Steps</em>, which he gives to all of his patients. It encourages a mindset on the part of the patient to take things in life in small chunks, to avoid being overwhelmed by reality.<br /><br />On the surface, this is both a simple and a very good idea, especially for a self-help book. It could be a bestseller if the book actually existed. But it doesn't...it was created by the writers of the film as a construct on which to hang part of the plot of the film. The doctor's character in the film needed to have written a book, and so they devised a simple concept to flesh out the movie.<br /><br />Ideas are easy. Especially the really simple ones. But an idea doesn't just spread without effort. It needs a champion.<br /><br />Here's a universal human truth: no individual can constantly remember everything that he or she "knows". Our brains hold a lot of information. I've read several different books on human psychology that contains redundant accounts of the same psychological experiments conducted during the twentieth century. This doesn't bother me, because even though I've already read the information before, I don't mind being reminded.<br /><br />If you have an idea that you want to see spread, you might think that presenting the information to others is redundant. But spreading an idea is not always about telling people something they don't already know; it can be about bringing something to the surface. The best way of doing this is to champion an idea. You can champion anything you're passionate about. It helps to be first, but this certainly isn't strictly required.<br /><br />You could champion an idea by speaking in public. Bring people together and rally them around the idea. Write a book on the topic, so people have a physical relic they can get behind. Any good idea is bound to spread, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum. <br /><br />Not everyone needs to be told, but most of us need to be reminded.
