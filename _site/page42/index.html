                      In the movie Thank You For Smoking, tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor goes into his son's classroom to talk about what he does for a living. After talking a little bit about questioning authority, he concludes his speech with, "So perhaps instead of acting like sheep when it comes to cigarettes you should find out for yourself." At this point, the teacher politely interrupts him by starting to applaud and ushers him out of the classroom.It...

                      I had one professor in college who used to take notes based on what his students were saying. I can't say for sure, but it didn't seem like he was making notes in order to refine his future lectures. Instead, he seemed he was actually making an effort to collect ideas from his students so he could reflect upon them later.I had lots of professors that used the Socratic method in an effort to get...

                      It's on my bucket list to drive to the house of the guy who invented the car alarm at three in the morning, bring lots of people with me, and we all hit the "panic" button that sets off our car alarms.

                      I was hiking in the mountains yesterday morning, and on my way down, I passed a guy on a bicycle who was riding up the trail. Now, riding up this trail is no small feat; it's incredibly taxing. You pedal furiously, and for every twelve pedals your feet put in, you move forward maybe 12 inches.When I'm up hiking during the day, I offer a friendly "Hello" to everyone I pass.

                      I was discussing the joys of Quants with a friend of mine, who was ranting and raving about how speculators on Wall Street don't really do any real work. He felt that they were responsible for getting us into this whole mess, and that none of them were really being held responsible for the trouble. After a few minutes of this, he took a breath and then thoughtfully remarked, "Although, they're probably doing more important...

                      If you're a writer and you want to publish a book, you don't just have one shot at success. That might have been true about 30 years ago when you needed the blessing of a major publishing house in order to get your book printed and distributed. When Random House finally called you back and said they wanted to publish your book, you made sure you returned their calls and showed up promptly to meet...

                      Last time I checked out at Costco, there was a sign hanging below the register that read, "Only one copy of your receipt can be provided to you."This is a simple point, but stores don't hang up signs like that without them being a response to customer inquiries. If you see a sign that says, "No Dogs Allowed", you can bet it's because people brought their dogs in and the store owner thought, "Gee whiz,...
