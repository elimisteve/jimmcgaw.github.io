                      You know the goop they cram into your mouth at the dentist when they need to get impressions of your teeth? They mix up this nasty tasting paste in a bowl, stick it into this plastic thing that covers your teeth, and then they stick that thing into your mouth. It feels like the stuff is oozing into the back of your throat, so your gag reflex goes bonkers, and all the while the dental...

                      I grew up in Michigan, the only state where aluminum cans and glass bottles have a deposit of 10 cents. In a handful of other states, the deposit is a nickel, but if you buy a twelve pack of Coke in Michigan, you're going to pay an extra $1.20 at checkout. The only way for you to get that money back is by bringing the empty cans back to the store, feeding them into big...

                      Lots of business writers talk about how the 21st century will belong to right-brained individuals. Businesses that leverage creativity in order to make (notice I didn't say "mass produce") interesting things that appeal to people will win out.<br /><br />The argument is simple: left-brained, logical processing is too easy to automate by using computers. In a global economy, trying to make stuff cheaper by creating a more efficient assembly line won't work because you can...

                      I remember reading once that for every four minutes that a person spends in the shower, on average, one more ton of carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and so the time we spend in the shower in the mornings contributes to the greenhouse effect.<br /><br />This isn't something that people think about at seven in the morning before they've had their morning coffee. So, I say we...

                      "People are getting dumber."<br /><br />I'm sure you've heard this kind of mentality before.

                      Here's someone using Blogger in a creative and funny way. It's clear after reading a few of the entries that it's not really a librarian being serious, but a series of jokes in the form of blog posts, probably written by a few people who work at a library and are poking fun at the "librarian" stereotype. The entries are always pithy and short, and I think it's an excellent use of the medium (thanks,...

                      The Humane Society, as well as other animal rights organizations and numerous pet-loving individuals, have helped spread the word about how terrible <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/">puppy mills</a> are. They encourage you to go to adopt a pet from an animal shelter, instead of supporting the puppy mills by buying a dog from a other retail pet stores.*<br /><br />I've been to a few pet stores in my day, and I've also visited a few Humane Society locations....

                      I was in Barnes & Noble the other day, coming slowly around a corner at the end of an isle, and I almost collided with another patron who was walking quickly to wherever they were headed. We would have run into one another, but I stopped moving and let them pass. They saw me when they came around the corner, but they didn't break their gait.<br /><br />This happens all the time when I'm out...
