        You know the goop they cram into your mouth at the dentist when they need to get impressions of your teeth? They mix up this nasty tasting paste in a bowl, stick it into this plastic thing that covers your teeth, and then they stick that thing into your mouth. It feels like the stuff is oozing into the back of your throat, so your gag reflex goes bonkers, and all the while the dental hygienist is saying, "Don't worry, it just <em>feels</em> like it's sliding down your throat. Relax."<br /><br />Fortunately, the pasty junk solidifies in your mouth in a couple of minutes at most, at which point it's mercifully removed. The last time this was done to me, I got to thinking about a post I read by the wise Kathy Sierra about how <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">speed helps creativity</a>. Not an unreasonable deadline put forth by your boss to finish a project where you pull an all-nighter fueled by pizza and cheap coffee, but having to come up with something quickly. It activates different parts of your brain. Removing the leisure aspect of creating, oddly enough, helps you to create in a lot of situations.<br /><br />The putty drying is the perfect deadline. Why don't artists try to sculpt with that kind of putty? Instead of clay, which lets you constantly redo and refine what you're creating, you've got <em>two minutes</em> to make something out of the goop. <em>That's it.</em> Once you hit the two-minute mark, you take what you've got as finished. You're either happy with it, or you get to start the whole process over again.<br /><br />I'm sure this so-called "Speed Putty" exists, but I couldn't find it doing a simple Google search.

        I grew up in Michigan, the only state where aluminum cans and glass bottles have a deposit of 10 cents. In a handful of other states, the deposit is a nickel, but if you buy a twelve pack of Coke in Michigan, you're going to pay an extra $1.20 at checkout. The only way for you to get that money back is by bringing the empty cans back to the store, feeding them into big machines, and taking a little slip of paper to the cashier, who will give you back your $1.20.<br /><br />It's not recycling by mandate. Instead, people are given a small financial incentive that encourages them to take the environmentally-friendly course of action or else the state gets to keep the 10 cents. And on the surface, it appears to work very well. As a result, very few aluminum cans end up in landfills.<br /><br />There's a book that was written about ten years ago called <em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>. Among environmentalists, this book is fairly well known and despised because it's extremely critical of the traditional environmental movement. I actually read the whole thing a few years ago, not because I hate environmentalism, but because I was curious what a reputable detractor would have to say. <br /><br />I'm not an expert, but the coverage of the material seemed, for lack of a better term, "incomplete". (So don't take my mention of the book as a recommendation.) The one lesson I took away from the book was that the most effective solutions to environmental problems tend to involve economic incentives. The deposit on aluminum cans is the perfect example. For each can, hold a dime ransom until people bring them back to be recycled. Money talks.<br /><br />I remember being in high school, living at my parent's house, and not having a job. Every three months or so, I'd find myself needing some money for something and remembering that there two or three trash bags filled with old pop and beer cans (not beer that I was drinking) that I could take to Kroger to cash in. Easy money.<br /><br />In Michigan, you'll often see homeless people rooting through trash cans looking for aluminum cans. They know that if they compile enough of them, they'll be able to turn them in and get enough money to buy a meal for themselves or their families. Some (but not all) use the money to buy alcohol or drugs.<br /><br />So, an interesting emergent property of the deposit on cans is a small amount of wealth redistribution. The State of Michigan doesn't care who bought the can originally, and will return the deposit to whomever turns the can in. Since a lot of cans end up in the trash, thrown away by people who would be too inconvenienced to take it back themselves, Michigan becomes a sort of Robin Hood, taking deposits from the rich and giving them to the poor.<br /><br />I was thinking about this yesterday, walking down a narrow alley off the street next to a Ralph's, which was covered in litter. Imagine taking the aluminum can deposit idea and applying it almost everywhere. Imagine almost every piece of trash on the street having a fixed dollar value. Imagine that we made everything recyclable, or failing that, made it reusable, and that we charged people a deposit on that stuff so they'd have to bring it back to get their money. If they don't bring it back, and it ends up in the trash, then someone else might bring it back for them. And if it ends up on the sidewalk or the street, then we'll have hoards of people who are willing to spend their days cleaning up the streets.<br /><br />A lot of grocery stores offer reusable bags that you can buy for a dollar or two, which you can bring back on subsequent visits. If you forget them, though, you have to either buy new ones, or take the disposable bags. (I have this problem.) However, if they "loaned" you the bags, and charged a deposit for each one they handed out, then I wouldn't have to worry about how many I accrued. If I end up with fifteen of them, I can take the excess back. If someone throws them away, then someone else can bring them back.<br /><br />Starbucks is working on a 100% recyclable cup. Why not make a reusable cup that people have to put down a 50 cent or dollar deposit for? They get it back when they bring the cup back, and it gets washed and reused again. (A friend of mine felt this seemed "unsanitary". She told me this as we were sitting in a restaurant drinking Diet Cokes out of glassware.)<br /><br />This is one way you can market wealth redistribution to those who oppose it: sneak it in as a solution to a big environmental problem.<br /><br />Now, I want to be perfectly clear: I'm <em>not</em> saying this is a solution to the homeless problem, or the litter problem, or any environmental problem. These ideas are imperfect because they accommodate some existing problems instead of solving them, and for any problem it solves, it likely creates a different kind of problem in its place. <br /><br />You better believe that if you charged a deposit for each cigarette sold, and then gave the deposit back for each butt that someone returns, you'd start to hear stories of homeless people trying to collect cigarette butts on the highway getting hit by cars. Given the Starbucks example, you end up with less trash being generated in the form of paper cups, but suddenly, each coffee shop is using lots more water to wash the reusable cups, and freshwater is a very valuable and scarce global resource. And while it may give the disadvantaged an incentive to pick up trash, it would probably start fights between them on the streets over claims of territory. And some (but not all) of them would use the money they get to buy drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />Michigan isn't the only state with a deposit on aluminum cans, but a lot of states don't have that yet. So they run <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk-5ITOxYak">silly little promos of cartoon butterflies</a> designed to teach children the benefits of recycling. But we're already working really hard (for better or worse) to teach our children just how important money is, and if they don't learn it in school, the real world teaches them that lesson soon enough. <br /><br />To me, it makes more sense to piggyback any environmental message you want to spread, or action you want people to take, on that very lesson. It's easier than coming up with your own lesson. The deposit is the perfect example of that.

        Lots of business writers talk about how the 21st century will belong to right-brained individuals. Businesses that leverage creativity in order to make (notice I didn't say "mass produce") interesting things that appeal to people will win out.<br /><br />The argument is simple: left-brained, logical processing is too easy to automate by using computers. In a global economy, trying to make stuff cheaper by creating a more efficient assembly line won't work because you can just outsource the whole process.<br /><br />There are lots of alternatives to trying to be the cheapest supplier of commodity goods. Target offers a good shopping experience through creative merchandising that doesn't break people's banks. Anthropologie takes this idea even further, by finding even more interesting and unique items to stock.<br /><br />But turning away from the larger companies, I'm really excited to see what kinds of businesses emerge from the latest economic downturn. I'm less and less interested in seeing what kind of stuff they have at the large chain stores and more interested in the merchandising and shopping experience offered by local merchants who aren't trying to compete on price. Someone wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retail-Superstars-Inside-Independent-America/dp/B002M3SPLY/">whole book</a> about 25 of the more interesting independent retailers in the United States. <br /><br />If you're a small retail merchant and you can't compete on price, your best option is to become an artist.

        I remember reading once that for every four minutes that a person spends in the shower, on average, one more ton of carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and so the time we spend in the shower in the mornings contributes to the greenhouse effect.<br /><br />This isn't something that people think about at seven in the morning before they've had their morning coffee. So, I say we either invent a coffee pot that sticks to tiles with suction cups and brews coffee in the shower...<br /><br />...or (better idea) invent a contraption that displays to people just how many tons of CO<sub>2</sub> they're releasing into the atmosphere. This could be a simple dial that just senses when the shower goes on, and a little digital readout that increments as the hot water flows.<br /><br />That would put the issue on people's minds, right when and where it matters.

        "People are getting dumber."<br /><br />I'm sure you've heard this kind of mentality before. Here's an author who wrote an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dumbest-Generation-Stupefies-Americans-Jeopardizes/dp/1585427128/">entire book about dumb I am</a>.<br /><br />It's interesting how often people latch onto a few specific events, or a few localized occurrences, and extrapolate from them that our society or (gasp!) the entire world is in decline. People watch more TV, spend more time on the Internet, listen to heavy metal, and less time reading books and listening to classical music. Intelligent people read books and listen to Mozart, and dumb people watch TV and listen to Metallica, so we must be getting dumber...right?<br /><br />I always wonder in response to these sorts of allegations: is anything really changing? Of course, some things change. Technology changes. Culture changes. The economy changes. But is it possible to point to a few things and discern from them that the world as a whole is actually getting <em>worse</em> in some quantifiable way? That's an awful lot of variables you're combining. It's too simple a conclusion about too complex a system.<br /><br />One or two hundred years ago, books were one of the few options available to people as a medium of communicating ideas to the masses. In some ways, they were the only medium. So that's what writers used to do: produce books.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that if people back then had access to the Internet, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, they would have been sharing ideas with one another en masse, just like we are today, because people, regardless of what time period they lived in or the tools they had access to, have always been opportunistic.

        Here's someone using Blogger in a creative and funny way. It's clear after reading a few of the entries that it's not really a librarian being serious, but a series of jokes in the form of blog posts, probably written by a few people who work at a library and are poking fun at the "librarian" stereotype. The entries are always pithy and short, and I think it's an excellent use of the medium (thanks, Lana):<br /><br /><a href="http://libetiquette.blogspot.com/">Librarian's Guide To Etiquette</a><br /><br />For anyone working in a retail job or any other one where you have to deal with the public, could you create something like this? Seems like a great way to blow off steam, especially around the holidays. Or how about the "Vegetarian's Guide to Dealing with Carnivores", or "Tech Support's Guide to Conceit".<br /><br />I wish I would have thought of this idea when I was working at Wendy's. For that matter, I wish Blogger had even <em>existed</em> when I worked at Wendy's. (That dates me, doesn't it?)

        The Humane Society, as well as other animal rights organizations and numerous pet-loving individuals, have helped spread the word about how terrible <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/">puppy mills</a> are. They encourage you to go to adopt a pet from an animal shelter, instead of supporting the puppy mills by buying a dog from a other retail pet stores.*<br /><br />I've been to a few pet stores in my day, and I've also visited a few Humane Society locations. In my experience, at retail pet stores, the animals are playing in pens together, there are toys, and everything seems colorful, like a commercial. At Humane Societies, they tend to be separated in cages that line a wall, and they all seem restless, confined, or miserable.<br /><br />Quick question: when you see the animals in regular pet stores in the mall, and then visit the animals at the Humane Society, which ones seem more like they came from a "mill"?<br /><br />In the for-profit world, there's something known as a "core competency", which is just a five-dollar way of saying "something we do better than our competitors". I don't think non-profits like the Humane Society view pet shops as their competition, but I think they should. The Humane Society believes they're in the business of holding animals in cages (in a humane fashion) until they can be adopted, and they feel that they shouldn't have to resort to a fancy storefront, or the dog-and-pony show, to accomplish that mission.<br /><br />There's a certain type of person that buys a puppy at a pet store, and a certain type of person that goes the extra mile and gets one from the Humane Society. By refusing to cater to the former, they seem to be limiting their audience to only the latter. Perhaps they're hoping people will change. It's noble of the Humane Society to think they can turn everyone into the latter kind of person. If that ever happened, you could argue that the world might be a better place, and they'd certainly have an easier time getting animals adopted. But is their mission to change people, or to help animals? Changing people is very hard.<br /><br />If they want to encourage more people to adopt animals, I think that the kindly retail storefront that's bright and shiny is exactly what they need to make people want to adopt a dog or cat.<br /><br />[* Update: In my original post, I specifically named "Petco" instead of using the more generic "pet stores". This post is about how keeping your customer's perceptions in mind and nice presentation is good marketing. In my efforts to articulate my thoughts, I made a flippant decision to single out Petco by name. This may have led readers to believe that Petco directly supports puppy mills. I have <em>absolutely no evidence</em> to support that claim. Creating the association between Petco and puppy mills, while it was done inadvertently, was unfair to them. If you're making a decision about where to adopt an animal, I encourage you to do what I did not, and carefully research the organizations you choose to support before making any conclusions.]

        I was in Barnes & Noble the other day, coming slowly around a corner at the end of an isle, and I almost collided with another patron who was walking quickly to wherever they were headed. We would have run into one another, but I stopped moving and let them pass. They saw me when they came around the corner, but they didn't break their gait.<br /><br />This happens all the time when I'm out in public, and it makes me wonder what would happen if I refused to stop moving, just the way they did. If I kept going, would they just wait until the last possible second to acknowledge that I wasn't going to stop, at which point they would stop themselves? Am I just the first person to quit in a game of chicken? The whole thing reminds me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>; because of the context, we could call this particular problem the "Shopper's Dilemma".<br /><br />What what actions earn me is adaptability. I was walking through the bookstore with a specific destination in mind, of getting from Point A to Point B. And I had the plan in my head, too. I had the route I was going to navigate through the bookstore mapped out in my head.<br /><br />When someone got in my way, when I encountered an obstacle I didn't expect, I stopped and waited. Stopping right there, for that length of time, wasn't part of my grand plan, but I quickly incorporated it into the plan out of necessity.<br /><br />People seem to be darting around with plans like this. The person who almost ran into me probably thought, "I'm done looking at Harry Potter books, now I'm going to go look at books filled with pictures of Cockatoos!" or something. And they started on their path. And my inadvertently getting in their way didn't sway them from their course. They were either unwilling, or, dare I say, unable to modify their plan.<br /><br />I don't know what a social psychologist would say about this, but I'll bet this explains why some people are so prone to road rage.

        More than that, I think, actually. Because questions are more compelling, more engaging, more thought-provoking. It's much easier to build an audience by asking the right questions. And given a big enough audience, the right question just might generate over a thousand worthwhile ideas.<br /><br />Wouldn't you agree?

        I'm not sure what was going through the heads of the first people who decided to take the green beans from the coffee plant, burn them, drip hot water through them, and then drink the resulting liquid.<br /><br />That's not exactly how it happened, but you get the idea. Getting from green beans to the final coffee beverage that all of us drink today is not logical at all. I imagine that the process of getting the green beans from their natural state into a liquid form that was drinkable took all kinds of trial and error, done by people who couldn't say with any certainty that they'd end up producing anything worthwhile.<br /><br />Just the idea of taking green coffee beans and turning them into a hot drink seems a little silly, when you think about it. We can thank those of our ancestors that chose to persist and follow through on something silly the next time you get a cup o' Joe.
