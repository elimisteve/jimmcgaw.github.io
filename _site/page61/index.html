        Not all product innovations are brand new things. When PetSport came out with TuffBalls, they did nothing more than take a couple of tennis balls, repackage them in a new way, and put them in a pet store to sell them to pet owners for way more than you could buy tennis balls in athletic shops. You could hardly call that a "hard" innovation, but it worked. People bought the tennis balls.<br /><br />Is that just stupid? Are they ripping people off and tricking them into buying something for more than it's being sold elsewhere? Of course not. People could plainly see they were just tennis balls in a different package.<br /><br />Recently, I think I saw a commercial for some "luxury" cat food, and the slogan was "Because your cat's worth it." (I Googled it, couldn't find any evidence that I ever saw that commercial. Was it just a nightmare?) In another example, think of the Friskies commercials where the food is served to some pampered, pretentious-looking Himalayan in a crystal dish. Does the cat care what kind of cat food it's eating, what's on the box/can, or how much it costs?<br /><br />Nope. Nor do dogs care where the tennis ball they're playing with came from. The package is for the people, and re-packaging the tennis ball was just what was needed to get people to pay more for it. You could criticize the merits of this, and claim that it's taking advantage of a weakness, but I don't see it that way. People are self-actualizing themselves vicariously through their pets by buying luxury brands. When you think about it, is there really any harm in building self-esteem that way? (Personally, I think it's a little odd, but I've never had a dog, and it's their money and their decision to make.)<br /><br />My point is not about pet owners, but instead: what other products do you see around you that just need a little repackaging? Can you find a different use for an existing product that people might want? Opportunities don't knock; they sit idly by, in silence, while you pass them each day. The better they are, the harder they are to spot.

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/09/pop-artist-collaboration.html">Pop Artist Collaboration</a></h1>

        Here's an idea for the music industry that might make them some money:<br /><br />Get a bunch of popular bands and artists who are interested in collaborating with another band/artist on an album. Create a list of the ones interested in this project (the reason they'd be interested will shortly become apparent).<br /><br />Once you have the list of bands will to do this, put that list up on a web site, so that the artists are searchable by name. Get people to go the site, where they can pick from any two of the bands listed, combine them, and vote for them to collaborate on an album together. Collect votes from people for a little while, and at the end, the two artists with the most votes have to go into the studio and write/record twelve songs together.<br /><br />There are some rules. First, each "vote" is actually a potential order. People voting provide their shipping and billing information, and do so with the understanding that if their pairing of artists ends up being the winner, they'll be shipped a copy of finished CD and charged $15 for it when it's done. Any votes for non-winning combinations don't get charged.<br /><br />Second, the winner must get some minimum of votes...let's say 100,000. The online voting campaign will be slated to run for a month or two. It ends when one artist pairing reaches the target vote count or time runs out. If time runs out, and nobody's won, then the deal is off. Nobody gets billed, and the artists aren't on the line to produce an album.<br /><br />When you come to the home page for this site, the top five runners are displayed, along with the number of votes for each. People can view the whole list of combinations created, along with the vote count for each. Each artist that's participating gets their own page on the site, where users can browse and sample their music. <br /><br />I think this would work because the craziest, most inappropriate pair is the one that's going to win. Aren't you mildly curious what Willie Nelson and Lady Gaga would create if they had to write and perform an entire album together? I know I am, and I might even order (vote for) that CD.<br /><br />The best thing about this is that you have the orders to incentivize everyone up front. If the winner needs 100,000 votes before anyone has to produce anything, and it's $15 per CD, that's $1.5 million of revenue they have to work with. If you offer each artist 15% of that, it's appealing enough that they might seriously consider it. And the producers would certainly be interested in working on a project with a guaranteed revenue stream.<br /><br />What do the artists get? Exposure, for one. People looking to make a crazy combination of artists would browse around this site, listening to samples, potentially listening to things they never heard. And if they get voted to do a collaboration, then they get the payoff (for a little bit of work, of course.)<br /><br />As for the money, the $1.5 million is just the beginning. That the <em>minimum</em> that the album is going to generate in sales, and it'll probably generate more, just because once the winner is announced, people will be talking about it. While the album is being recorded and produced, both of the artists involved could do interviews on YouTube talking about the experience working with the other person.<br /><br />The great thing about this is the word of mouth. Whereas most CDs that are produced incur some promotional costs, this concept pretty much markets itself. Why? Because if I vote for two artists, I know that I need 99,999 other votes in order to have any shot at making it happen. So people who really want to see their pairing win are going to tell everyone they know, to get the word out. You just have to make sure the ad money you spend to create awareness of the contest and the site to begin with targets the right subset of people who love music, and love to talk.<br /><br />There's a few ethical rules that I would lay down for the record company that does this, (since it's my idea): <br /><br />1. For each vote, you're capturing and storing a lot of billing and contact information for a ton of people. As long as you're storing the credit cards, follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI compliance</a> guidelines and keep them secure. When you're done with them, and you've charged the winners for their order, delete them. Better yet, let PayPal handle the orders, they're professionals.<br /><br />2. You'll have their email address: use it to contact them when the contest has ended to announce the winner, and to let them know when the winner's CD has been released, and don't email market them about anything else. <em>Nothing.</em><br /><br />3. You'll have a bunch of other contact data, too, like a mailing address for each customer. Don't sell this information to anyone else. I know you'll be tempted because it would be a great way to make some quick cash, but resist the urge. <br /><br />Naturally, the artists that get involved have to have mainstream appeal or else you're never going to get 100,000 people to agree on a single combination. But what I like about this idea is the fact that you let consumer demand what it is that you choose to produce. I believe this was done by a manufacturer a few years ago: they unveiled a few product ideas, let people vote for them, and the winning idea was shipped to those who cast their vote for it. <br /><br />If any of the recording companies did this, it would be a refreshing sign that they're finally ready to start seizing the opportunities provided them by the new rules, instead of whining and getting litigious because of the slow death of the last century.

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/08/the-top-internet-surfers-make-waves.html">The Top Internet Surfers Make Waves</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">
        <span class="date">Feb 8, 2010</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        According to the book <em>Citizen Marketers</em>, the ratio of surfers to active contributors on the Internet is about 100-to-1, which is 1% of the total. So, in the blogosphere, 1% of the people reading blogs are also writing on their own blogs. On YouTube, 1% of the people watching videos are making and uploading their own. On Flickr, 1% of the people browsing photographs are taking pictures with their own camera and sharing them with the world.<br /><br />Assuming that number is accurate, here's the question: Why is it so low? One percent is an extremely small portion, even if you take into account that many people with Internet access lack access to technologies that would enable them to make videos or take pictures. But when you consider the extent to which the Internet has made the tools of production and distribution available to everyone, why are only one percent of people making their own contributions?<br /><br />My guess is that it's fear. People cling to their ideas because revealing them would open you up for criticism, and people almost never react to what you create the way you had hoped or expected. And that's terrifying.<br /><br />But there's value in just <em>doing</em>. My brother recorded a dozen songs, almost all of which he wrote himself, and you can hear them on his Facebook page. They're not <em>great</em>, but they're certainly interesting. More importantly, he went to the trouble of creating the songs, and then putting them out in public for others to hear. That puts him in a very, very small minority.<br /><br />I'll concede that the blogosphere and YouTube since their inceptions have become repositories for loads of unfathomable crap. But the promise of the Internet never was to make everyone a great writer, film maker, or photographer. Nor was it to constrain its content only to that which meets a certain standard. Instead, it affords everyone the <em>opportunity</em> to be a contributor, and to be heard at the same time.<br /><br />Why do I blog on here? I don't think I'm a particularly interesting person, but I'm not going to apologize for that. If you want elitism, go hang out at an Ivy League school with the PhD's who have tenure and you'll see how awful it is. <br /><br />Besides, the Internet has revealed its own brand of elitism that has nothing to do with quality of content. Instead, what puts you above everyone else is the very act of making something, because <em>everyone can, but very few do</em>. It's those who take advantage of the opportunity before them over those who passively consume. If you create something and put it out there on the Web, you become part of the top one percent of people hanging out on the web, and I call it the "top" because those who create anything are better than those who create nothing.<br /><br />Here's the question the Internet is asking each of us: "What's stopping you?"

        The outlet for your creativity determines, in a big way, what shape your ideas will take as you develop them.<br /><br />Imagine that you're a comedy writer for your favorite television show. At the moment, mine is "30 Rock". If you're being paid to come up with ideas for dialogue and plotlines, all of the sudden, everything you read in the newspaper becomes a challenge. You start thinking, "How could that be turned into something interesting that happens to Jack Donaghy in one episode?" or "Could this be worked into a joke that happens in a conversation between Frank and Twofer?"<br /><br />Without an outlet, your ideas don't get developed or go anywhere. One of the theories I read recently about neuroscience is that if you don't use the ideas you think of, your brain stops giving them to you. That kind of makes our brains sound like indignant drama-queens, doesn't it? (Brain: "Fine, you don't like my ideas? Well...I'll just stop giving them to you, then!" Talk about sour grapes.)<br /><br />If you're a Tweeter, your first thought when you get an idea is: can I say that in less than 140 characters?<br /><br />When I had an interest in doing stand-up comedy during college, suddenly, everything I thought of, I started trying to turn it into a bit I could do onstage. Now that I'm writing, I work with every idea I have to turn it into a book idea or blog post.<br /><br />Here are some random outlets I just came up with that you could use to create stuff:<br /><br />1. Greeting cards.<br />2. Coffee mugs<br />3. T-Shirts<br />4. Bumper stickers.<br />5. Cartoon strip.<br />6. News article.<br />7. Food.<br />8. Fortune cookie fortunes.<br />9. Your Facebook status.<br />10. An empty canvas.<br /><br />You can pick the outlet. Or, even better, you can do what <a href="http://gapingvoidgallery.com/">Hugh MacLeod</a> did and come up with your own. (He does witty little sketches on the backs of business cards.)

        While managers have "The Apprentice", married couples have "Wife Swap", and those on the dating scene have "Blind Date", the television show "Shark Tank" is the reality television show for entrepreneurs. If you've never seen it, it takes five successful entrepreneurs (the "sharks) who have lots of money to invest. The show contestants come into the room to present their own business startup ideas and product inventions, and ask the sharks for money in exchange for equity in their business.<br /><br />Some of the ideas are laughably bad. Others have a lot of potential, and sometimes, the sharks will start competing with one another in an effort to get in on a new business idea.<br /><br />In a recent episode, a young bother and sister duo presented their new product <a href="http://www.greasemonkeywipes.com/">Grease Monkey Wipes</a>, which are individually wrapped wet wipes designed to get industrial grease off of your hands. It's an excellent idea, and not only have they developed a great product, they've managed to design a logo and a package that look great. The branding is really terrific.<br /><br />Of the sharks, the most "business-like" among them is Kevin O'Leary. In case you watch the show, he's this guy:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 116px; height: 142px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S2t6fLl150I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/dDrOuyoF6r4/s320/oleary.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5434572051458680642" /><br /><br />He's the Simon Cowell among the five sharks. If he doesn't like your idea or see any potential in it whatsoever, he won't be coy. He'll tell you exactly what he thinks is wrong about it, even as the other four try to gently turn the contestants down.<br /><br />This past week, he turned down investing in Grease Monkey Wipes because of a lack of "proprietary content". The actually grease-cutting power of the wipes themselves is, according to the couple, attributable not to chemicals but to a natural citrus juice, which is probably difficult to patent. Because they lacked anything that couldn't be easily replicated by competition, Mr. O'Leary politely declined to invest in their business.<br /><br />Proprietary content, that is, the stuff that's protected by patents, seem to make investors and venture capitalists feel more secure with a company, because it usually gives you a legally binding head-start over the competition in getting to market. I'm not going to call into question Mr. O'Leary's decision, because it's his money, and he's welcome to invest it wherever he feels comfortable. (He's probably smarter than me, anyway.) But I do wonder why he feels the need for proprietary content to exist in order to feel comfortable with a business.<br /><br />Put another way: MP3 players existed long before the iPod came out. Despite this, they didn't garner widespread adoption among music listeners until the iPod was released. It was the lifestyle branding and ease of use. This interests me because, as a technology geek, I saw the potential for MP3s a long time ago, and felt that digital music was far more convenient than CDs. But the convenience or superiority of the technology wasn't enough to get MP3 players to win out.<br /><br />Without Apple, would MP3 players have gone mainstream yet?<br /><br />A few years later, the Zune came out from Microsoft. It still hasn't caught as much of the digital music-listening market as Apple has. The portable MP3 player wasn't invented by Apple, it was merely branded by Apple, and it's managed to hold up over time, even without the kind of proprietary content you'd think the sharks were looking for.<br /><br />You could argue that the iPod did have proprietary content: its design. People loved talking about how great the iPod looked, and that helped it win out. And to that end, Grease Monkey Wipes do have a trademark: their logo. The crazy-looking monkey on the front package of every wipe is trademarked, and it is pretty eye-catching. I think they're sitting on top of something great, and even without the any patents, the branding and design should be enough to put them ahead...even when the Zune of the industrial grease wipe market inevitably emerges.<br /><br />Incidentally, two of the other sharks ended up investing in Grease Monkey Wipes, which seems like a great move.

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/05/brainstorming-with-a-grievance-list.html">Brainstorming with a Grievance List</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">
        <span class="date">Feb 5, 2010</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        Here's a idea I came up with last month for generating up with new business ideas: create a grievance list. Write down a list of things that really irk you about something, and then try to come with ways that you would change them to make them better.<br /><br />I live in California, in a city where real estate is priced quite outrageously. For a small one-bedroom apartment, I'm paying nearly double what people would pay just about anywhere else. Needless to say, since I'm not filthy rich, I can't afford a place that has its own washer and dryer in each unit, so I have to go to the laundromat once every two weeks or so.<br /><br />Now, in my experience, laundromats are miserable places. They're hot, stuffy, and full of people waiting around in tedium for their clothes to be ready. I wonder why this is? People, by their very nature, waste a lot of time in this country. We sit in coffee shops, chatting about nonsense with the people we're with and play on our laptops. We go out to eat so we can talk about our day. <br /><br />Why not combine wasting time anyplace else with wasting time in a laundromat? Why don't laundromats give people something to do while they wait? Why not a hybrid laundromat/coffee shop, so people can get a coffee or tea and surf the 'net while they wait for their clothes to be done? Let them go through a door and enter a Starbucks-esque atmosphere where they can kill time. It's the perfect opportunity to upsell your customers a cup of coffee.<br /><br />People wouldn't even have to be in sight of the machines with clothes. In lots of restaurants, while waiting for a table, we're given coasters that buzz when our table is ready, giving us the freedom to wander away from the waiting area. When the table is ready, the coaster buzzes and vibrates, and we can go claim our table. Why couldn't someone create a similar portable mechanism for a washing machine and a dryer?<br /><br />Anyway, getting back on topic, even without keeping customers occupied, what exactly could be done to improve a laundromat? Here's my grievance list and quick proposed solution to each:<br /><br />1. They're cramped. Washers and dryers are always crammed as close together as possible, in the interest of maximizing how many loads you get per square foot. On a busy day, you often have to work really hard to avoid bumping elbows with the people around you. Why not open up the space a bit, give people more room?<br /><br />2. Moving from washers to dryers is a pain. Most laundromats are split in half: on one side, the washers, and on the other, the dryers. That means the switch, the point at which you have an unwieldly sopping mess of wet clothes, requires you to move the most throughout the place. Why not pair them up? One dryer next to every washer, so the switch doesn't require a massive move.<br /><br />3. Security. There's no guarantee that your clothes won't be stolen. With the washer dryer combo idea, why not give each pair its own private room secured with a key?<br /><br />4. The television sucks. The idea is to give people some diversion. A good idea, in theory, but most laundromats that have a TV in them, it's always some thrift shop cathode ray tube piece of junk and it's tuned to some crappy soap opera/local news station, and people aren't watching it so much as they are <em>staring</em> at it vacantly in the absence of anything better to do. How about a flatscreen hanging on the wall playing the latest Pixar flicks? Line up some chairs theater-style so it's easy for people to sit and watch.<br /><br />5. Kids all over the place. Give children something to occupy themselves with. If not television, some kind of play structure. A pit of plastic balls. It works for McDonald's.<br /><br />6. No free wireless access. It's no longer 1997, so laptops are owned by the majority of people and not just introverted techno-geeks and CEOs of IBM. Let us go online. Better yet, offer some kiosks with Internet. (and none of this "pay-by-the-minute" shit, either...make them free.)<br /><br />The point is not to find a great idea for a business you could actually start. (although, that's always a possibility.) Actually, I have no doubt that you could fault some or all of these ideas. (think about cost efficiency, target market mismatch, etc.) But it's just an exercise that helps you brainstorm ways of improving things, especially things that are widely stigmatized as commodities in people's mind. The perception is that all laundromats are the same, that none of them offer anything of value to customers over the next one, so people just choose the one closest to them, or the cheapest one.<br /><br />Differentiation often commands a price premium in the marketplace. Even if you can't charge more, why don't more people try to differentiate a laundromat?

        I've been going to Starbucks for over ten years now. In that time, the sweetening station hasn't evolved very much. Here's a simple addition they could make that would make a drastic improvement to the well-being of coffee drinkers everywhere: a sweetening syrup called agave nectar.<br /><br />If you're a diabetic, you know what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index">glycemic index</a> is. It's a numeric value assigned to foods that tells you how much that particular food will affect your blood sugar levels after you eat it. If you're diabetic or pre-diabetic, you need to avoid consuming foods that have a very high glycemic index. Even if you're not a diabetic, consumption of foods with a high GI spikes your blood sugar, and if you spike it a few thousand times too many over the course of your lifetime, you might find yourself facing diabetes.<br /><br />Anything with a glycemic index of over 70 is considered to have a high glycemic index. Table sugar (sucrose), high-fructose corn syrup, and honey are all sweeteners that have very high GIs of 92, 89, and 83, respectively.<br /><br />Agave nectar is a sweetening syrup that is made from the agave plant, which is, yes, the same plant from which they produce tequila. Interestingly enough, this very sweet syrup has a glycemic index of only 27. It doesn't have that strong of a taste either...I've used it to sweeten tea and it doesn't overpower the natural flavor of the tea the way that syrup or honey does.<br /><br />So, here's what Starbucks could do: first, educate your employees about what the glycemic index is, and which foods have high ones. Make sure they have a good idea what the numbers are. Teach your employees about the health implications. Once you've done that, start putting agave nectar out at your sweetening stations, next to the honey and other sugar. <br /><br />Here's what would happen next. People would go over to sweeten their coffee, see it, and a few (but not all) of them would see the bottle of it sitting there, get curious, go up to the counter, and ask the barista, "What's that?" And then the baristas tell them all about the benefits of agave nectar over other sweeteners. <br /><br />What's in it for Starbucks? A few customers are already going to know what agave nectar is, and they'll appreciate its presence at the sweetening station. The rest of the curious people that inquire and learn what it is will have a story to tell. It's great word of mouth: "Do you know what I learned about at Starbucks today?" If Starbucks actually made this move, it would start conversations. It would draw people into the store. (It would start with Starbucks, and when it caught on, the rest of the coffee bars would shortly follow suit.)<br /><br />More importantly, this would fall under the umbrella of Corporate Social Responsibility. If Starbucks did this, it would result in much better publicity for agave nectar, as well as awareness of the health implications of the glycemic index, than the American Diabetes Association could ever hope to accomplish with any television commercial.

        I find history interesting because it teaches you that the changes we're facing today probably won't result in the catastrophe the doomsayers are claiming. <br/><br/>One small example: the creation of libraries (free books!) did not destroy the publishing industry. By the same token, the introduction of the Kindle (digital books!) is not likely to destroy it in the coming years, either. <br/><br/>People like to whine because they hate it when the game changes, especially when they've spent years benefiting from the current set of rules. Usually, the louder ones whine so much because they haven't studied their history.

        Back at the start of the 20th century, the washing machine was invented in order to automate the process of washing clothes. This was done because women had to spend several hours a week washing clothes by hand. I imagine it was a laborious and mind-numbing task, and I don't envy women from the pre-washing machine epoch.<br /><br />Now, 100 years later, we have the Internet and Google at our fingertips in order to help us look up information quicker than ever before. This has led several people to question whether or not this ease of access to information is making us "dumber". Since we can look things up on Wikipedia so easily, we have less incentive to memorize information, and so we end up with (arguably) less knowledge stored in our brains.<br /><br />Technology affords us convenience (and sometimes environmental detriment), but it has little impact on our level of intelligence. More importantly, asking whether or not the convenience of Google is making us "dumber" is asking entirely the wrong question. It's like debating 100 years ago whether or not the introduction of the washing machine was going to make those women who used to spend hours washing clothes more lazy.<br /><br />Here's the question we should be asking: Now that we don't need to use our brains to store facts that we can easily look up, what are we going to do with our brains instead? Be creative? Make art?<br /><br />Now that you have a washing machine, what are you doing with all that extra time?

        Nope, I'm not kidding. If you're a freshman or sophomore in college, your major is still undeclared, and you're interested in a field that will help you make the world a better place, consider getting a business degree.<br/><br/>I've been there before. You take all kinds of random classes in an effort to find a noodle that sticks to your brain. You try sociology, psychology, social problems, social work, etc, all in the hopes that one of them will appeal to you and you'll be able to decide on a choice that will not only satisfy, but let you help the world by doing some philanthropic every day while you work.<br/><br/>Forget the social sciences. Here's the big secret that the School of Sociology at your university won't tell you: almost all non-profit organizations operate exactly like their for-profit counterparts, <em>from a business standpoint</em>. So if you want to make a big splash and help charitable organizations, you'll have a much easier time finding a job and helping them run their day-to-day operations if you learn business. Why won't the sociology department tell you that? In most universities, schools are competing with one another for student enrollment. The social work department doesn't want to lose you to the business school.<br/><br/>But it's true. Just like corporations, 501(c)3's need employees that can do bookkeeping, human resources, marketing, public relations, and management in general. Unfortunately, people trained in those fields are off working at corporations because the pay is so much better than at non-profits. So non-profits have trouble attracting employees trained to handle business functions to work for them. And those few employees with a business background that do work for non-profits are often not very good at what they do.<br/><br/>Here's one example of how a trained businesswoman has made a huge difference: the work of Jacqueline Novogratz for the <a href="http://acumenfund.org/">Acumen Fund</a> was possible because she had a financial background. She understood how loans work, and was able to start a company that now helps many thousands of people around the world because she understand micro-finance. She chose to leave a very well-paying job in New York to go help poor people in Africa. (Jacqueline wrote a great book about her experiences called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605294764/">The Blue Sweater</a>.)<br/><br/>If money really isn't everything to you, if helping people means a lot, consider looking at business school. Research what job roles your favorite non-profits needs to hire and find the one you like best. Later, after college, when you're working for the American Red Cross, you can read all those depressing books your Sociology teacher would have made you read for their class.
