        I tend to act differently around people that I know are parents.<br /><br />As much as I try to treat people equitably, I can't get past this one. It has a lot to do with someone that lots of parents have told me: "Having kids changes everything in your life."<br /><br />I don't fully understand it, but I think I have a cursory grasp of what they're saying. Having kids shifts your priorities. It changes the way you see the world. It changes the way you act and what you value most in life.<br /><br />It's something that I don't understand, so I respect it. And the best strategy I have for dealing with these people is this: shutting the hell up. The best I can do by talking more to a parent is make myself sound stupid.<br /><br />But one thing I have noticed is that a lot of parents are supremely productive people. Again, I'm not a parent, but I can only imagine that kids take up a lot of a parent's time. Despite this, I know lots of people with kids who still manage to accomplish a lot with their time. I'm taking a class right now, and my professor is a parent who is the chairman of the college department, holds a full-time job, does side work, attends game programming conferences, and teaches classes. And he's got kids.<br /><br />I know people without kids, and without full-time jobs, who aren't nearly that productive. (e.g. me) This leads me to believe that having kids, even though it consumes time, makes the parents more mindful of the time they have left over in the day, and forces them to manage it. Whereas if you're like a lot of people, you have ample time, but you tend to squander it.

        "Every revolution destroys the old before it brings the benefits of the new." -Clay Shirky.<br /><br />About three months ago, the city where I live lost both its Borders and Barnes & Noble. They were both located a few blocks from me, right across the street from each other. They both shut down in the same week. This sent me shopping to the one Borders left standing in our area ten miles to the West. Earlier this week, they announced that one was closing, too.<br /><br />The sad thing is, almost everyone saw the Borders closures coming many years ago. The whole thing has been felt like a large, public accident that's happening in very slow motion. The only thing that's really surprising about it is that it took this long for it to happen.<br /><br />Things that happen overnight tend to get a lot of publicity, but the rise and fall of most things that matter in our lives are closer to the rack than the guillotine. The whimpers herald things to come, not the bangs.

        <a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2011/03/03/amanda-hocking/">Amanda Hocking</a> has been getting a lot of ink lately. She's a self-published author of fiction on the Kindle. She sells her little e-books for $1, $2, or $3 each. The latest news is that she's making millions of dollars without having ever gone through a traditional publisher.<br /><br />If you were looking for evidence that this is even possible to do, there it is. <br /><br />I've been telling everyone I know, with all my fervor, that if you're a writer, there's money in the Kindle. Most people shrug complacently; they don't disagree with me, but they're waiting it out. They want some assurance that it will work for them before they commit any time to things.<br /><br />That's usually a good strategy because it conserves energy, but it shouldn't be the rule for everything. Most people demand evidence, and while they're waiting for it, the people with the passion to make things happen aren't waiting for evidence, they're executing. And they're the ones that win because they'll get there first.<br /><br />The Kindle as a publishing platform is relatively new. It's possible that selling books through it was a bad idea two years ago. It's possible that it will be a bad idea two years from now, or whenever the market is saturated. But right now, <em>now</em>, there's possibilities. Not guarantees, but the possibilities are big ones if you figure out how to do it right.<br /><br />If you have a book, however short, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1440488886/">format it for the Kindle</a> and put it out there.<br /><br />Go.

        Here's something that I figure is at least partially true: in terms of government and most larger businesses, transparency is not complete.<br /><br />This isn't a conspiracy theory, because I'm not being specific. And I'm not saying it's entirely a bad thing. But I think that, in general, there are some things we don't hear about. They might be defense plans, it might be accounting fraud, or any number of things, but I don't believe the picture is clear. This is often intentional.<br /><br />I've met enough people in my slowly lengthening time on earth to know that I'm not the only one who feels like this. So let's assume I'm not entirely wrong, but that I'm just not sure of the details.<br /><br />This thread that permeates our culture is responsible for the proliferation of gobs of misinformation. Conspiracies about the events of 9/11. UFOs. I saw a small portion of a terrible documentary on Netflix the other day claiming that if you removed processed foods from a culture's diet, all tooth decay disappears and dentistry becomes completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Those are the details. People with a story, who rush to fill the gaps. And it works because people want to fill the gaps. We need the story to make sense of our surroundings.<br /><br />Yes, the pharmaceutical industry is full of people and companies who are dishonest, and they gouge when it seems morally reprehensible at times. But that alone doesn't mean that Kevin Trudeau and his "natural cures" aren't one big swindle.<br /><br />This is the power of a story: contradict a wrong with enough finesse, even with another wrong, and there's a good chance people will believe that it's right.

        After bassist Cliff Burton of Metallica died back in the 1980s, the rest of the band started holding auditions for his replacement. One of the people who auditioned was a guy by the name of Les Claypool.<br /><br />Les Claypool is the lead singer and bassist (how often do those two things go together?) of a band called Primus. In terms of alt-rock bands of the 1990's, Primus achieved a great deal of success. Every rock bassist I've ever met in my age range absolutely worships the ground that Les walks on; they look up him both as a musician and an innovator.<br /><br />And yet Metallica didn't hire him. By their own admission, it was because he was "too weird". They just didn't think his style of playing was a good fit for their band. And undeniably, it had <em>nothing</em> to do with Les' lack of talent, because it abounds in his music.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind next time you get a rejection letter from a prospective employer.

        About five years ago, Netflix created a contest that would award $1,000,000 to any person or group of people who could improve their movie recommendation algorithm by 10%. To aid contestants, they released an enormous sample dataset of users, movie titles, and ratings. Each username was replaced with a numeric code. That way, users could be compared to one another, and the general rating habits of a single user could be analyzed, without divulging potentially identifiable information about the user.<br /><br />The problem is that this didn't really work. Shortly after the data was revealed, a couple of computer scientists took the large Netflix dataset and compared it with other publicly available data sources, one of which was IMDB. By comparing the ratings of a user in the Netflix data with reviews and ratings posted in other places, they were able to de-anonymize the Netflix data and put actual names to the numeric codes.<br /><br />Oops.<br /><br />They didn't do this maliciously, but they were interested in demonstrating a point: there's enough data out there that it's possible to reverse engineer someone's identity from information, even if that information has been completely stripped of personal information. It's almost asymptotic...as the amount of data stored in multiple locations about any one Internet user approaches infinity, the potential for actual privacy approaches zero.<br /><br />Maybe it doesn't matter for movie ratings, but there's an awful lot of data being compiled by hospitals and medical clinics around the country right now. There's not an IMDB for medical records, but it's not a stretch to say that such a dataset, if released to the public stripped of patient information, couldn't be de-anonymized as well. Insurance providers would certainly have an incentive to do this.<br /><br />The two computer scientists who matched up the Netflix users are working on an algorithm that will actually allow large datasets to be released in a way that prevents any reverse-engineering-of-identity hullabaloo. I think their research is very important; in the coming years, releasing datasets to the general public to solve problems is likely to become not only common but necessary. To do it in a way that protects privacy at the same time can only be of great benefit to us all.

        One of my neighbors in the apartment complex where I live is the executive director and founder of this non-profit organization. It's a small music studio in the local Boys and Girls club, where middle and high school students can go after school to get free lessons and use the equipment to record music. <br /><br />The community has been generous; lots of local musicians have donated their time to tutor students, and several people have donated computer equipment and instruments to make the studio comparable to a professional, for-profit recording studio.<br /><br />I asked my neighbor about how he came to found the organization before its humble beginnings. He shrugged, smiled, and told me that he had maxed out a few credit cards to get it off the ground (which he's still paying off). Even now, he works at the studio during his days, and spends his evenings valeting at a local restaurant in order to pay his bills.<br /><br />All so he can give grade-school kids the means to record their music.<br /><br />I can almost guarantee that this wasn't part of his original plan. And this course of action certainly didn't come to him from an aptitude test he took while in high school, or at the behest of a guidance counselor. He had an inclination, and he leaned into it, without knowing exactly what would happen or whether it would work out.<br /><br />So far, from what he tells me, he's making it work. And he's just the kind of protagonist you want to root for.

        A repeater is a cheap piece of commodity hardware. As far as computer components go, it doesn't do anything particularly fancy. Its job is not to produce a signal of its own, but to take an existing signal, strengthen it, and then send it on its way. This enables it to travel further over network lines.<br /><br />Most of us are repeaters. We're a whole lot more creative than repeaters, and we like to apply our own biases to things we've heard before we spread them, but our role is to spread ideas. There's an evolutionary process that manages the content of the human network. The good ideas are sustained over many people and time, while the bad ones die out.<br /><br />Racism, sexism, agism, or class discrimination may have organic elements to them--that is, they might have their origins, at least partially, somewhere in the human gene pool. But whatever their origins, its cultural norms and social structures that determine whether ideas bloom and prosper, or wither and die.<br /><br />Or, as Kurt Vonnegut once wrote: "We are who we pretend to be, so we must be very careful about who we pretend to be."

        A lot of intersections have "Push To Cross" buttons for pedestrians trying to get through them. At a few of them, I've noticed the signals don't change if you don't push the button. So if you don't bother to push the button, the little white man won't appear and you're stuck with the orange hand, with no indication of when to cross.<br /><br />But at a lot of intersections, the walk/don't walk signals toggle even if you don't push the button. And at all intersections, whether or not the signals change, pushing the button seems to have no effect on the timing of the traffic lights. It doesn't speed things up. <br /><br />If that's true, why put them there?<br /><br />I think it's because people need to feel that they have something they can control. More often than not, reality is beyond our grasp and we're at the whims of what life throws at us. We can't get across the street any faster, but we can pound the button with our finger, and then it feels faster.<br /><br />Giving people the feeling of control might be just as important, or useful, as actually giving them control.

        We don't always remember everything exactly as we heard it.<br /><br />News articles, Facebook statuses, and Tweets all flow in, as an endless digital river of content. There's value in a lot of it, but most things don't stick over the long term. <br /><br />A friends posts that he just saw a really terrible movie that he hated. "Don't see [Film X]." I read it, it sinks  and disappears into the gray matter between my ears.<br /><br />Six months later, and someone asks me if we should rent Film X. And when I try to dredge up what I heard, I cannot recall any kind of positive or negative association. The only thing I can remember is that I've heard of it before.<br /><br />It isn't just me; it's people in general. In a world where we're barraged with information, we often lose the significance of each piece of data that enters our brains. <br /><br />This doesn't quite equate to the whole "all publicity is good publicity" maxim, because I firmly believe that people are inclined to remember extremes. But that does mean that, given the choice to mention something that I really hated and something I really liked, I'll mention the latter. I want the good stuff to stick.
