        In the 1970's, someone decided to do a study of college professors. The setting for the experiment was a lecture hall in which each professor was giving a speech in front of a large audience of students. And all of the students in the classroom were participants in this experiment. (I wish I had been in on this kind of thing at least once when I was in college.)<br /><br />The professor stood while lecturing, and walked back and forth, addressing both sides of the lecture hall. The students on the right side of the room were instructed to nod in understanding with the professor when he was looking at them. The students at the left side kept their heads still.<br /><br />You can probably guess was happened: it wasn't too long before the professor was anchored at the right side of the room, speaking to the nodding students.<br /><br />I know a lot of people who find fault like there's some kind of reward for it. But people don't crave criticism; they crave positive reinforcement. It's a powerful tool, and yet in comparison with its less effective counterparts, it's astonishingly underused.

        There's always something. If there isn't, you should do something else.<br /><br />I had a friend once try to convince me that we should set up an online store selling drop-shipped goods. In theory, the website itself would do little more than put content out to Google, capture orders, and pass them on to the drop shipper, who would fulfill them and handle any customer service issues.<br /><br />I thought it was a terrible idea, just because it was all too easy...almost Faustian easy. Simple reason: last time I checked, customers pay for value added. And a site like the one I described isn't adding a whole lot of value.<br /><br />No, customer service isn't easy. If you open a store or restaurant, you're going to deal with people who are having a bad day and who, for their own selfish reasons, are going to take it out on you.<br /><br />I wish I made the rules, because it would be great to give the devil his due and make life easy. Until then, a cardinal guideline: if it's all easy, it's probably not worth doing.

        About a year after I got out of college, I had an idea for a website. And, since I didn't have any money, I decided to build it myself. It wasn't much of an idea...just an online liquor directory that would let people post reviews of their favorite liquors. My hope was to use it to get promotional booze samples from liquor companies.<br /><br />The thing was, I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't know how to build a website. I didn't know the first thing about HTML or CSS or anything about databases. But I decided to start, and see the project through, even though I was pretty sure that in the end, the whole thing wouldn't amount to very much.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this, not just about building websites, but about the value of <em>starting</em>. Since then, I've gone to lots of my friends and pitched tons of crazy ideas for things we could start. And the truth is that most people don't want to start. They will find any excuse not to start. They'll fault the idea. They'll talk endlessly without ever taking the steps to get something done. They'll come up with an endless list of reasons to hide, and why they won't go out on a limb.<br /><br />This isn't a character flaw, but it's the way most people are. Once you start doing things, once you've gone down that road, it kind of becomes addictive, and you start doing lots of projects all at the same time, until you're overextended and doing a dozen things at once. It's a scary prospect. I can't blame anyone for shying away from it.<br /><br />But to anyone who aspires to accomplish, that is the big secret. There's any number of things that draw out the basic point, but the best way to get things done is to follow the same instruction manual every day for the rest of your life:<br /><br /><em>Start</em>.

        I was speaking with a gentleman last night who told me that he thinks truly good people volunteer to help others, but they never talk about the fact they volunteer. They just do in silence. <br /><br />I have another friend who lashed out both the members of the tea party and the people who marched to make fun of the tea party. Waste of time, he said, adding that if you want to make a difference, you should go volunteer at a soup kitchen and then "don't tell anyone about it."<br /><br />You can definitely go overboard with telling people about the details of your own personal life. That being said, I don't think that talking about how you volunteered your to help a charity is enough of a transgression to negate any good you might have done. The old adage about moderation might apply here, but if you're doing good, I don't think it hurts to talk about it. Quite the opposite, actually.

        About two and a half years ago, I moved from Michigan to California. The city to which I relocated has a large number of bicycle lanes. To me, in my limited set of experience with cities in the United States, this is pretty unusual. Many of the bike lanes are so wide that you can fit an entire car in them. When I first moved out here, I noticed that several cars pulled into the bike lane when they approached intersections and went to turn right. Essentially, they were treating the bike lane as a makeshift right turn lane. <br /><br />At a glance, this seems inconsiderate or opportunistic, doesn't it? I'm not even a bike rider, but the state sets aside some concrete for people out biking, and cars use it to make right turns a little faster.<br /><br />But it wasn't just a few people that did it. Several people did. It seemed to be the rules instead of the exception put forth by a few inconsiderate perpetrators. So, I started to do it too. It was certainly less awkward than attempting to turn right from what was, in effect, the middle lane.<br /><br />Later, I went to take the test to get my California driver's license. Turns out that pulling into the bike lane before turning right is exactly what you're supposed to do, so long as there's room and you're not going to run over a bike rider. Lesson learned; I was a little too quick to judge.<br /><br />But initially, I didn't start doing it because I knew it was the legal thing to do...I did it just because that's what everyone else was doing. Most of the time, we can't know everything, so we fall back on imitating others. Behavior is contagious.

        With rumors of the iPad 2 dropping this month, startups are asking after the specs and features it will feature. Everyone is looking for the inside scoop, because once they get that, and if they get it before everyone else, they can get a jump on building the next big thing. There are probably even people trying to get details onthe iPhone 5.<br /><br />I remain unconvinced. If you want to engage in insider trading, then yes, you've got to find someone on the inside who's privy to information to which the rest of us don't have access. But that's not only illegal and probably a bad idea, but the overwhelming majority of innovations in history didn't come from people with exclusive access to protected or confidential information. They came from people with access to the same information as all of us, but with the vision to realize that something new could be done with it.<br /><br />Anyone could have started Starbucks. It wasn't as though there was a secret gourmet coffee society that Howard Schultz was a part of that clued him in to upcoming trends. He didn't read the secret writing on the wall only because he knew the secret handshake. There was no writing and no handshake, just his own imagination and the follow-through on an idea.<br /><br />You're already in the know, whether you want to admit it or not. The only question is whether you're going to choose to do anything about it.

        Thirteen years ago, if you asked a layperson what the Internet was, there was a good chance they would point you to the Yahoo! homepage. Back in those days, lots of people used to type web addresses into Yahoo!'s search box and find the site they wanted in the results.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet if you did that now, a lot of non-tech-savvy people would take you to Facebook. Maybe Google.<br /><br />The term Facebook seems to have become synonymous with discussions about the loss of privacy in the digital age. And yet, it's something that most people don't fully understand (including me.) And social networking has become such a large part of everyone's daily lives that broaching the subject makes people a little bit uncomfortable. It's a little like bringing up risks of alcohol poisoning at a college fraternity party...each person, as an individual, is aware of the risks involved with binge drinking. But there is a bunch of group dynamics and social psychology involved as well.<br /><br />Here's the unspoken question: what, exactly, are we supposed to do? Stop Facebooking?<br /><br />I do think that changes in privacy issues in the digital age have radically outpaced reforms in privacy law over the past 20 years. There are some precedents that haven't been set, simply because they haven't been tested yet.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think it's as big of an issue as some people thing. It's nothing to be alarmist about. Like most things, it's not a matter of right and wrong, but a matter of trade-offs. To me, it's worthy sacrificing a bit of my privacy for the convenience of keeping in touch with people.<br /><br />It's a personal choice, but I'm reasonably well-informed about the issue. The problem comes from people who are making decisions about what they choose to do based on the information available to them. And unfortunately, I think it's the uninformed and unaware that are going to bring the legalities of this issue to light in the next decade.

        I realized this morning as I was furiously pounding away on the code for a personal project that I'm in the very fortunate position of not having anything to lose. I'm an individual, flying by night, and since the work I do on my own time doesn't bring in money I depend on, I can push the envelope, break things, and the consequences are minimal because I have nothing to lose.<br /><br />Contrast that with an established tech company where things have been pretty much the same for the past five years, and everyone is afraid to change things, lest the effect of a small change ripple and cause negative repercussions. These situations exist where stability seems real, and <br /><br />And yet, I don't think the strategy should vary much between the company with nothing to lose and the company with everything to lose. The goal for both is simple: stay in motion. Don't stop, and don't stagnate. I think that's especially true if you're an established company, because sooner or later the world is going to pass you by. And if you're not moving, you're going to miss it.<br /><br />The more you have to lose, the more you should probably be acting as though you have nothing to lose.

        If you're interested in seeing what goes on in the lecture halls of MIT, you can browse a healthy portion of their curriculum online, for free, at their <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">Open CourseWare site</a>. <br /><br />MIT charges tens of thousands of dollars for their students to attend their classes and hear those lectures, so the fact that the put it all online, free of charge, for anyone to see, is a little surprising. But from a business perspective, it makes a good deal of sense. It increases the number of people who can get a taste of what it is to be a student at MIT, which should increase applications, which increases the number of people they turn away, which makes them more exclusive.<br /><br />You can get all the information you need to know what an MBA knows by reading thirty or forty books. But people don't pay for information; they pay for accreditation. <br /><br />The Internet has caused lots of things to go open source. Music is well on its way to becoming a public utility instead of a product. I'm anxious to see what happens in the next ten years, as higher education increasingly ends up online.

        Let's say you have a large set of truly random, widely distributed numbers. What portion of them, if you counted it up, would start with the digit 1? How about 2? 3? Most people intuitively say it's 1 in 9, an equal share of probability, for each one. <br /><br />In reality, this isn't what ends up happening. In a large random sampling of numbers, each has roughly a 30% chance of starting with 1. (Or, another way to put it: you can expect 30% of them to start with a 1. About 17% of them will start with a 2. The percentages decrease progressively as you work your way up to 9.<br /><br />It's called Benford's law. Among other things, it's used by the IRS to analyze tax returns. If someone fudges the numbers on a corporate tax return, you would expect to see more deviation from the first digit distribution predicted by Benford's law, so those returns are more likely to get an audit. Oops.<br /><br />A professor of statistics conducted an experiment with her students once. She stepped out of the room and had two groups of students flip a coin 100 times. The first group used an actual coin, and wrote, in order, whether they got heads or tails with each toss of the coin. <br /><br />The second group was instructed to toss a "mental" coin. One member of the group randomly called out "heads" or "tails" 100 times. Just like the first group, they tallied up their results.<br /><br />One last thing: the professor didn't know which group was doing which.<br /><br />When the professor returned, she looked at both of the tallies from both the real coin and the mental coin, and quickly made a determination about which group had flipped an actual coin. She did this several times, and was always able to spot the real coin right away.<br /><br />How did she do this? Because, according to her, 100 actual coin flips tend to contain runs of six or seven heads in a row (or tails in a row). In the mental coin flipping group, the results tended to go back and forth from heads to tails with an eerie consistency.<br /><br />We don't understand true randomness because it doesn't always feel right, and it doesn't always look the way we would expect it to.
