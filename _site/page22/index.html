                      You remember the drill: a group of students from your school are going to leave school and visit someplace, and you've got to take home a permission slip for your parents to sign. The school couldn't just pull you out of your regular routine and take you someplace. They had to get the okay from your folks. At other times, if you wanted to do something, you had to raise your hand and ask the...

                      In the 1970's, someone decided to do a study of college professors. The setting for the experiment was a lecture hall in which each professor was giving a speech in front of a large audience of students. And all of the students in the classroom were participants in this experiment. (I wish I had been in on this kind of thing at least once when I was in college.)The professor stood while lecturing, and walked...

                      There's always something. If there isn't, you should do something else.I had a friend once try to convince me that we should set up an online store selling drop-shipped goods. In theory, the website itself would do little more than put content out to Google, capture orders, and pass them on to the drop shipper, who would fulfill them and handle any customer service issues.I thought it was a terrible idea, just because it was...

                      About a year after I got out of college, I had an idea for a website. And, since I didn't have any money, I decided to build it myself. It wasn't much of an idea...just an online liquor directory that would let people post reviews of their favorite liquors. My hope was to use it to get promotional booze samples from liquor companies.The thing was, I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't...

                      I was speaking with a gentleman last night who told me that he thinks truly good people volunteer to help others, but they never talk about the fact they volunteer. They just do in silence. I have another friend who lashed out both the members of the tea party and the people who marched to make fun of the tea party. Waste of time, he said, adding that if you want to make a difference,...

                      About two and a half years ago, I moved from Michigan to California. The city to which I relocated has a large number of bicycle lanes. To me, in my limited set of experience with cities in the United States, this is pretty unusual. Many of the bike lanes are so wide that you can fit an entire car in them. When I first moved out here, I noticed that several cars pulled into the...

                      With rumors of the iPad 2 dropping this month, startups are asking after the specs and features it will feature. Everyone is looking for the inside scoop, because once they get that, and if they get it before everyone else, they can get a jump on building the next big thing. There are probably even people trying to get details onthe iPhone 5.I remain unconvinced. If you want to engage in insider trading, then yes,...

                      Thirteen years ago, if you asked a layperson what the Internet was, there was a good chance they would point you to the Yahoo! homepage. Back in those days, lots of people used to type web addresses into Yahoo!'s search box and find the site they wanted in the results.I'm willing to bet if you did that now, a lot of non-tech-savvy people would take you to Facebook. Maybe Google.The term Facebook seems to have...

                      I realized this morning as I was furiously pounding away on the code for a personal project that I'm in the very fortunate position of not having anything to lose. I'm an individual, flying by night, and since the work I do on my own time doesn't bring in money I depend on, I can push the envelope, break things, and the consequences are minimal because I have nothing to lose.Contrast that with an established...

                      If you're interested in seeing what goes on in the lecture halls of MIT, you can browse a healthy portion of their curriculum online, for free, at their Open CourseWare site. MIT charges tens of thousands of dollars for their students to attend their classes and hear those lectures, so the fact that the put it all online, free of charge, for anyone to see, is a little surprising.
