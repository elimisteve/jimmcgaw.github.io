        I was talking to my cousin's wife on Christmas. She's an elementary school teacher who just graduated from college and is now on the hunt for her first full-time job. She was telling me about the tactics she used during her student teaching in order to make sure that the kids in her class behaved.<br/><br/>One method she used was called "Gimme Five". You say this to their students, and then they're supposed to put up their right hand (as though they were being sworn in under oath in court) and do five things: "Sit up straight. Mouths closed. Listen." And so on. There's five of them, and the kids are supposed to be able to rattle them off if you ask them to, and to execute them if you say, "Gimme five." It's like calling the kids to attention.<br/><br/>Another one she mentioned in passing was called S.L.A.N.T., a mnemonic where each of the five letters stands for something, similar to the "Gimme Five" approach.<br/><br/>I asked her where these methods came from, and she told me that she wasn't entirely sure. Then I asked her what she would do if she ever came up with her own acronym or other method that made it more effective for her to get her student's attention whenever she was ready to teach them. How would she tell other teachers about it? Where would she publish it? She didn't know the answer to that question, either.<br/><br/>For so much of our academic careers, we're instructed simply to follow instructions. We're given protocols and expected to follow them and there's little, if any, time devoted to teaching about the shortcomings of the current methods or what to do if the current methods ever don't work for us. We're never given any instruction on how to be creative if the need arises.<br/><br/>Little children often believe that vegetables come from the grocery store, and are not grown in the ground on farms. Similarly, a lot of adults take it for granted that the methods and inventions they use in their day-to-day lives had to be created by somebody who recognized the need to create them.<br/><br/>We're not taught to recognize the need to create. We're taught to leverage and endure what's already there for us.<br/><br/>It's a lesson that most of us learn because it's easy. In the computer programming world, there's a development methodology called "agile". It's what we use at the company that currently pays my bills. There's good things about it, but there's things I don't like, and no part of me was ever encouraged to build or improve upon agile if I ever felt the inclination. (Someday, maybe I'll develop something better and try to promote it in the software world.)<br/><br/>Granted, there are acronyms everywhere in our world that are supposed to help us remember standardized steps, and people doing very important work (like, say, elementary school teachers) are unlikely to need them to remember steps after a few years of teaching. Empirically, you just develop instincts about what works and what doesn't to keep kids attentive. Experience is a much better teacher than process. And it can be difficult to distill the benefit of all of your experience down into one acronym like S.L.A.N.T. for new teachers to use.<br/><br/>Whatever your profession, when someone tells you how to do something, I think it helps to ask why. Why are things done this way? Who came up with it? Under what circumstances were the current methods created? What specific problem(s) did they solve when they were created? By becoming a historian, you'll start to understand what drove the great innovators in your field to create. And when you end up in a difficult situation in your career, you'll have an easier time recognizing when you should be using the creative process yourself instead of falling back on laurels.<br/><br/>And if you're a professor teaching students about their future careers, you'll be much more effective if you play the role of an historian. Teach the history behind the "how to" processes that you're teaching your class. You'll empower your students with the knowledge of the past and make it easier for them to deal with their futures when they arrive.

        I read a lot of books; the hard part is finding the good ones. Reading fiction is one thing, because you can just pick a story that sounds entertaining, but I tend to read business books and titles that contains general ideas about the world. I don't know about you, but in an age of an almost unlimited supply of books to read on Amazon.com, I have to use some kind of criteria in order to thin the herd. <br/><br/>One way I narrow the selection is to look at the average star rating of books from all users that posted a review. If it's a title or author I'm not interested in anyway, I make sure that it's got at least four out of five stars before I even consider it. I'm looking for the "social proof" element. That is, if it worked for everyone else, maybe it'll work for me. <br/><br/>Sounds good in theory, until you realize that most great ideas, really brilliant insights, are rejected by the majority when they're first brought to light. If it's a book with ideas that really challenge the status quo, most people are <em>going</em> to hate it. They're going to give it bad reviews and write comments about how "off his rocker" the author was.<br/><br/>Not all good books will fall into this trap. A lot of good ones contain ideas that, while new and groundbreaking, still resonate with people, so they end up taking off. Malcolm Gladwell's <em>The Tipping Point</em> is a good example of that. And a lot of books that get poor reviews are just plain bad due to poor writing, or because the author actually <em>was</em> off his rocker. Kevin Tredeau falls into the latter category.<br/><br/>But I think that we should be paying attention to new books that are getting bad reviews from people on Amazon who seem to be resistant to change. The ideas might be untested or have yet to prove themselves successful in reality, and yes, that's a scary prospect to face. But if the ideas seem good, in spite of the resistance of a few Amazon customers, you end up in possession of knowledge that few others in the world have.<br/><br/>Finding the ideas backed by social proof is easy; just ask your friends for suggestions. The potential ROI is much higher if you seek out ideas that have value because they are <em>scarce</em>. <br/><br/>Better yet, write your own book, and don't try to get good reviews. Write something unique. If you do it right, some people will hate it, but then it's much more likely others will love it.

      <p class="post-meta">

      <div class="content">
        Back in the early 1990's, some of us played a computer game called "Myst", which was a really more of a series of puzzles tied together around an imaginary world and a loose narrative. Either you played it because you loved games like that, or you were like me, and played it merely because you hadn't discovered the World Wide Web yet. (Actually, the game wasn't that bad; in an era of games like Halo, it's easy to knock, but I liked it quite a bit.)<br/><br/>There is now a small group of people who are making an effort to get the Myst computer game, as well as the series of paperback novels that followed it, made into a movie. You can track the progress of what's happening at the <a href="http://mystmovie.com/">Myst Movie</a> website. They have a blog, and they update it pretty frequently with pre-pre-production notes, which, for this kind of project, basically involves the blog contributors writing about their late-night coffee-fueled brainstorming sessions.<br/><br/>That's not the amazing part. The amazing part is, people are reading. They're listening. They're commenting. For the Myst Movie crew, that's great news.<br/><br/>Consider a different scenario. Let's say you have a piece of crap movie and it stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. For the purposes of this hypothetical example, let's call it <em>The Proposal</em>. The success of the film will be based on how many people go see it, so the challenge you face, as a person hired to promote it, is to create a buzz about the film. The traditional method of doing this is to create a handful of trailers and then put them <em>all over the place</em>. <br/><br/>Hope the trailers stick in a few people's heads, they talk about it to their friends, drag their boyfriends to see the film, etc, etc, and hopefully you make back what you put into it so you can make another one.<br/><br/>The people working to create the Myst Movie are facing a slightly different challenge. Recently, they ventured out to Hollywood to ask for funding from a production company. My entire sales pitch to Hollywood executives would have been: "Take a look at the website for the movie. People are reading and commenting on stories of us <em>driving around Los Angeles looking for a Starbucks</em>! They love it! They want to see it!"<br/><br/>The buzz is already there; demonstrate that, and, if I were a Hollywood executive, you would have my attention. Whether I said yes or no would depend on how you answered the following question: "How are you going to leverage this small group of enthusiastic fans to generate interest amongst more mainstream fans?"<br/><br/>There's a small niche of enthusiastic fans who are scattered around the country (maybe around the world) and they're all coming together on this site to rally their support for the idea. That's a huge, huge asset to the production team. However, if all of these scattered pockets of fans never get the idea out to everyone else, it's at best a wasted opportunity. So, how do you make sure they tell everyone else?<br/><br/>That's not an easy question to answer. Although I'm drastically inexperienced in such matters, here are a few suggestions to answer the above question:<br/><br/>1. Successful products have the marketing built in. The writers of the movie actually have the most difficult job. They can't write something so obscure and "artsy" without any material that's designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. You have to have universal appeal in there so that if a Myst fanatic takes a friend to see it, the friend will also find merit in the storyline and tell other people about it. But if you make it <em>too</em> lowest common denominator, then the fans will be pissed and no one will end up liking it. This is why so many movies suck; one-by-one, each person involved in the project removes every last rough edge in the hopes that it will appeal to everyone. It's a tough balance to strike, and even harder to bring out in the writing. When in doubt, err on the side of fans.<br/><br/>2. Give these "early adopters" the tools they need, both on and offline, to spread the word about it to their friends. Some of them are nerds who are in love with the Myst franchise and will talk, unabashedly, about it to anyone they meet. Several others will be more timid and might keep quiet out of fear of sounding like a nerd. The trick is to make the frightened ones not feel as nerdy talking about the movie. The inevitable T-shirt design must be more than just the cover of the box the game was sold in with "Myst Movie" on the back. It has to be interesting and eye-catching, and still identify itself.<br/><br/>3. Make trailers and put them everywhere. (obvious, I know, but it still has to be done.)<br/><br/>4. Sooner or later, the content of the blog has to shift from production notes to something more engaging. Now, I might be dead wrong about this one. Perhaps Myst fans would love following the "On the Set" blog because they feel like something is happening. It makes them feel close to it. I still think there's a better use than what's there now, but I can't say for certain what that would be, although I have one idea, which I detail in my last suggestion:<br/><br/>5. Myst fans liked solving puzzles. Give them a puzzle to solve surrounding the release of the movie. (This is the part of the marketing I'd love to be in on.) This is the most fun step, and, if they do it right, the creators of the movie will have a runaway success on their hands. The key is to make it a puzzle that everyone is interested in solving, not just Myst fans. Hide clues somewhere (on a single website, or, even better, scattered all over the Internet in plain sight), and have them all point to a single solution, a big reveal, that points to the movie. Where they hide the clues, what the clues are, and to what they are pointing really isn't terribly important, so long as they incentivize everyone to participate. (That last step is the hard part.) Make it fun. Make it a game worth talking about. Offer a prize to the people who figure it out, like the aforementioned T-shirt, so they can walk around promoting your movie for you. Heck, give them five, so they'll hand them out to friends. Is it a gimmick? Sure it is. <br/><br/>I understand that artists resist marketing because it seems like cheating and, if you succeed, you're never really sure how much of your success can be attributed to the merits of your art versus the marketing hype that went into it. On the surface that makes sense, but artists have to realize that if you create something truly great and it doesn't achieve the recognition you had strived more, that doesn't mean you've failed.<br/><br/>Without any marketing, a lot of really great, brilliant ideas would probably be unknown to us now. Van Gogh committed suicide. Would we know him today if he had lived out his life to the end and started selling his paintings in his old age? Suicide is far from being a gimmick, but it helped his story to spread.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot more to it than this, but that's a start. Talk is always cheap, while execution remains the most scarce, and therefore valuable, natural human resource. And I'm certainly not encouraging the Myst team "sell out" and start doing anything that compromises their vision. Maybe I'm reading this wrong, and it's intended to be a small, low-budget film with a small, cult following. (But I get a sense they want to make the next <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.)<br/><br/>As a means of full disclosure, I'm old high school/college friends with one of the writers that's currently working on the project, but I haven't talked to him in a long time. (He's the guy from whom I stole the name "godlikeguy" for this site.) I was really just interested in exploring the marketing that would go into creating a movie based on some existing concept with dedicated fans.<br/><br/>I do hope that the Myst team creates something grand, and that they achieve what they set out to do. Hopefully the Hollywood executives are listening intently, because there's a big opportunity there. And as a final piece of advice: if the Los Angeles fatcats ask you to bring them a blue page, turn around and run.

        I live in a very small city which, according to the official census, only has about 90,000 people in it. There's more than that if you take into account the greater area, but it's still much different than where I originally came from: Detroit. There, in the land of sprawl, you feel lost in a system that's much larger than the community.<br/><br/>In downtown Santa Barbara, you start to notice the same homeless people on the street every day. You recognize them, and at times, they clearly recognize you right back. After a year and a half of living in this smaller city, I actually know a few of their first names and have had conversations.<br/><br/>This led me to notice something very interesting: a few of them have dogs. And the other day, I saw one of them pushing a cart filled with cans and scraps of food and clothing, closely followed by a dog. They turned down an alley towards a dumpster behind a building to forage for food, and the dog turned down the alley right behind him.<br/><br/>This wasn't the first time I had a dog following a homeless person around, but it struck me how loyal a dog must be to stick with someone who is so down on their luck. I'm not a big dog person, or a cat person. Actually, I'm not partial to any animals. But sometimes, people seem so quick to turn their backs on other people when things aren't going well.<br/><br/>If you have a family to feed and you're facing hard times, the dog might be the first thing to go, to save precious financial resources. It's understandable, but unfortunate.<br/><br/>The dogs could leave their masters, who are so down on their luck, to go find a companion that has a house, steady income, etc. But they don't. They stick it out with their masters, loyally spending their days at their side, following them wherever they go.<br/><br/>That's really inspiring.<br/><br/>My girlfriend had a great idea: there are often lots of homeless people asking for money on the main street where I live, and a few of them have dogs. Even if you don't feel like giving the the people any spare change, why not carry around a pocket full of dog treats that you can give the dogs? <br/><br/>I think a dog treat manufacturer should run a commercial showing this in action. They'd suddenly have people who don't own dogs interested in buying dog treats. Heck, you could create a dog treat that didn't contain anything that the majority of dogs are allergic to and market it as such. The product name? "Alpo Alms".

        If you're trying to create something that people will use, here's some advice that an aunt gave me a long time ago: "One of the main goals of invention is to make a hard thing easy." <br/><br/>That may sound obvious, but at the time, for me, it was not. I had just spent a few hours rigging up a little ramp so that if a person wanted to turn off their alarm, they had to turn a little crank and it would move a rock up this little conveyor belt and drop it onto the "Snooze" button. My aunt pointed out that this wasn't a great invention because reaching over and hitting a button isn't terribly difficult to do after waking up. Turning a crank is. I was 9 years old at the time, and the lesson was learned.<br/><br/>But it's not just about making a hard thing easy. Really great innovations take it one step further. They don't only make the hard thing easy for the person to do...they're also crafted so that the person forgets that they're doing the hard thing at all.<br/><br/>If you're a writer, strive to write so that your words don't get in the way. Make it easy for the reader to forget that they're reading a book.<br/><br/>If you're creating a piece of software that helps people pay their bills online, make it easy for them to forget that they're paying those bills.<br/><br/>If you're designing a car, make it easy for the person to forget that they're operating a large piece of machinery that puts them at risk while they're driving it. (Although, in the last case, perhaps you shouldn't make it <em>too</em> easy for people to forget that they're driving.)<br/><br/>When I pay my bills online, my bank's web site has an interface that constantly reminds me that I'm using the Internet to pay bills. It works without any problems (most of the time), but the <em>finesse</em> is missing. It feels like I'm using a web site. I read a book recently called <em>Stumbling On Happiness</em> by Daniel Gilbert, which was a great book, and contained great ideas, but in almost every paragraph, the author's writing style got in the way. He often over-developed his point, or drew an analogy that reminded me he was writing. He's a really good writer, but the actual writing called attention to the fact that I was reading a book. I often had to re-orient myself and start reading again.<br/><br/>If you can apply this to whatever it is that you're creating, if you can really get that perspective from your customers and put to work for you, then you're already more than halfway there. When you think of a way to invent an alarm clock that wakes people up, and also makes it easy for people to forget that they're being yanked out of their morning slumber to prepare for their workday, you'll have a winner on your hands.

        We have lot of different kinds of crime shows: "Law & Order", "CSI: [insert city here]", "Numb3rs", "Castle", "The Shield"...which each one has a niche that makes it unique, most of these shows tend to follow the same format: episodes open with a crime scene, police officers spend the hour tracking a criminal, and in the end, they put together the puzzle and catch the bad guy. I'm sure detectives sit around in bars with one another discussing how unrealistic these shows are, because nothing is ever that cut-and-dry. Of course, it's not reality, it's entertainment. They not trying to mirror the real worth, they're trying to fill the time between ads.<br/><br/>Of course, the crimes are always very typical of a police officer trying to solve crimes in a large metropolitan area: homicide, rape, assault, child abuse. Not pleasant things, but it makes perfect sense to package that sort of thing as a television show because those kinds of stories have always drawn an audience to the evening news.<br/><br/>With the big break of the Enron scandal eight years ago, followed closely by Worldcom, another series of crimes came into the limelight: corporate fraud, deceptive bookkeeping, embezzlement, collusion with Arthur Andersen, etc, etc. Why not have a show where law enforcement cracks down on people on Wall Street who are committing these kinds of crimes? Perpetrators are fewer in number than street criminals (would be my guess), but the few of them certainly make victims of a greater volume of people.<br/><br/>Does the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> apply to those who commit crimes and the number of people who are affected by those crimes?<br/><br/>So, since we have so many street crime shows, why not have this kind of show? I think I've heard this idea before, several times, from several other people. The most notable among them is Michael Moore, who had a brief parody of "Cops" in his movie <em>Bowling For Columbine</em>, where FBI agents crack down on Wall Street crooks. <br/><br/>It's a good idea. I think the Hollywood executives didn't try very hard to actually adopt the idea for a couple of reasons. First: it was pitched by Michael Moore, who, even for a moderate, comes across as something of a detestable leftist toady with a reputation for stretching the truth. That's ad hominem, but I'm merely pointing out it's easy for the brain to ignore what it can easily discredit, fair or not.<br/><br/>More importantly, it would be a really difficult thing to pull off. The format of "Cops" doesn't quite work, and it can't be like a traditional cop show from the point of view of the investigators, because the law enforcement officials investigating these kinds of crimes have really boring day jobs. They're accountants, mostly. They went to college to learn how to be uninteresting. It requires real creativity, as a television writer, to package that idea in a way that will sell.<br/><br/>Instead, what about a show that deals with white collar crime, but deals with it from the standpoint of the Wall Street crooks themselves? Instead of the investigators being the regulars, have the perpetrators return week and week, and have the show focus on their exploits. If you do it right, they would be interesting people, and their relationships would be compelling because, under that kind of pressure, they would have been strained.<br/><br/>As much as we would like to write off Jeffrey Skilling as being a mechanical automaton without any soul or conscious, he <em>was</em> human. He spent years rationalizing something that, deep down, he must have known was wrong. I don't know about you, but that's interesting. It's the perfect archetype of the human condition, albeit a very extreme one, and the nature of post-industrialized society.<br/><br/>Even with that in mind, it's still pretty easy to reject the idea outright because, who's going to tune in and watch white collar criminals screw over people? Well, the last decade has given us the answer: with the success of the television show "Madmen", however, the objections have been given their counter-argument. The show focuses on the lives of men in the early 1960s working at a Madison Avenue advertising agency. It's one of the darkest shows on television right now, because the lives of these people, given the time period, is not pretty. It was a time when men drank liquor, smoked cigarettes, and wore their sexist attitudes on their sleeves all day long.<br/><br/>And yet, it works. It's entertaining, and I think the key reason is because it's a window into the past. If I may turn the mic over to my homeboy Oscar Wilde for a second: "The nineteenth century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass." Perhaps we can't stand to watch a show that's loosely based on the Enron scandal because we don't feel we've moved past it as a culture yet. Maybe the idea, while great, is still too close to home. But even that explanation is still incomplete, because people watch "CSI", and those crimes are (supposedly) happening all the time, almost everywhere. <br/><br/>Maybe because we can carry mace and feel like we have more control over "smaller" crimes like that. Maybe because homicides and rapes "bleed" more and they just make good (easy) television. Maybe because with a show that has a new format, the television executives are worried it's too big of a risk to produce it.<br/><br/>I remain confident that it will emerge on a network eventually. Give it twenty years, give or take.

        Oprah once gave every single member of her audience a car, presumably just because she was feeling generous. The scene that it caused in the studio audience, of woman screaming with joy, became a thing of legend. It was very entertaining, and well worth every penny that she spent. (I thought it was funny that later, all those women were surprised to learn that they had to pay taxes on the value of the car. Talk about fine print.)<br/><br/>Oprah has her own magazine and, like every other magazine on the planet, it's loaded with ads. You have to flip past ten pages of ads just to get past the table of contents. I've always wondered: do the executives working at the companies that buy these ads actually sleep well at night thinking that they've given their company exposure? Aren't most women just flipping right past all of those pages to get to the content without paying them a second thought?<br/><br/>If Oprah wants to give something away, and a to <em>whole bunch</em> of her fans instead of a select few, why not run the magazine without any ads? Yes, I understand how magazines make money, and how the circulation numbers drive the magazines profitability, etc. But it's O Magazine...in terms of readership, she's got volume. Does anyone really think that she couldn't turn a profit from the magazine without any ads at all?<br/><br/>If you have to sell something, why not sell companies pages in which they can write articles that make the readers interested in their products. Most of the articles are ads anyway. They talk about Dr. Oz's new book or whatever else Oprah might be interested in telling her readers about that month. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, why don't all magazines do this? Force the people buying ad space in your periodical to actually generate content directed at the reader about the product they're trying to hawk. It wouldn't work for everything, and the people writing the "ads" would have to try pretty hard to engage the readers. But I get the impression that ad agencies spent a lot of time in meeting developing marketing strategies...why not direct all that effort into creating "guest editorials" that talk about your product?<br/><br/>Individuals could buy space too. Want to write an article about your charity and have it read by the readers of O Magazine? You just need to pay the advertising fee and the space is yours.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a dangerous idea because it blurs the lines between the ads and the actual content of the magazine. One virtue of the existing system is that the ads are pretty easy to discern, and, therefore, easy to ignore. Maybe that's a feature in and of itself.

        "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" has a pretty terrible name, when you think about it...there must have been a late-night caffeine-fueled session at Unilever where they really tried to think of a good name to position the product relative to butter. As the sun came up and the tequila supply was starting to run out, they threw up their hands and settled on the one idea written on the whiteboard that wasn't terrible. And to their credit, it worked great. Later, they came out with the spray container for their product and Fabio is remembered well for his role in the ad campaigns.<br/><br/>More recently, we got salad dressings in the same spray bottles. You can buy most of the typical flavors to spray on your salad, and you can count the number of calories easily, as it's only one calorie per spray. Very appealing for those health-conscience people eating their salads at work, at their desks, and need dressing in a convenient dispenser.<br/><br/>Where has Hershey's been during all of this? They still have the syrups--chocolate, caramel, and strawberry--that come in the usual bottle that you can drench ice cream in. Where is the Hershey's chocolate spray? They should formulate a thin consistency chocolate syrup that can be sprayed onto food, and make it one calorie per spray. Running commercials with kids and moms spraying the stuff onto bananas and strawberries as they eat them. Make a caramel one and show people spraying it on their shots of espresso to freshen them up. Only one calorie per spray!<br/><br/>Just do me one favor: if you need a CGI-created spokes-animal to hawk the stuff in your ads, just make sure it's less annoying than the Geico lizard.

        When we receive information, we're almost always asking ourselves one question: "Why should I care?"<br/><br/>When you're sitting in class listening a professor drone on about the book you were supposed to read the day before, but didn't, you're asking yourself that question. In an era of infinite media and a shortage of attention spans, we all have a "relevancy index" that acts as a barometer to determine how closely we need to listen to what we're hearing, and whether or not you can ignore it. You're probably pretty good at zoning out during commercial breaks on television and then tuning back in when the show you're watching comes back on. <br/><br/>Even now, as you're reading these words I'm writing, you're asking yourself why you should care and, if my analytics are telling me anything, it's that I've got a precious few seconds to answer that question for you, or else you'll click the "Back" button and I'll never see you again.<br/><br/>Think of a teacher or a professor you've had in the past that you really, really liked. You might not have even liked the subject matter they were teaching about, but you really enjoyed their class. Chances are good it's because they did a good job of answering that question for you before you even had the chance to ask it of yourself. I had a Biology class in college that was absolutely a delight to go to. I would sit there, transfixed by what the professor was saying, hanging on to his every word. I even looked forward to it, and let me tell you, I couldn't care less about <em>Biology</em>.<br/><br/>It worked because my professor led off each class period by answering the question: "Why should I care?" Once you've answered that question, you've got my attention. If you reinforce the answer periodically, throughout the lecture, I'll gladly listen attentively without any objections.<br/><br/>Great teachers build bridges. There's a chasm between what you're trying to teach me and the little narrative that's going on inside of my head all day. Students, on average, are probably worried about dozens of other little things that have nothing to do with what you're trying to teach them. I'm not saying you should outright start each lecture by blatantly answering that question; the correct approach is much more subtle. It's making an authentic connection by generating interest.<br/><br/>If you're a mediocre teacher, then you're more than likely coasting on the fear that most students have of failing the class. You're falling back on the fact that you're students <em>have</em> to care, because if they don't, you'll fail them and they'll flunk out of college and then they'll have to work at Jiffy Lube for the rest of their lives. If that's what you're doing, they'll try only hard enough to succeed, but they won't be happy about it, and you haven't actually helped them much. It's a lousy bridge, but one a lot of teachers build. If you're this kind of teacher, the best you can hope for is to get tenure, and spend the rest of your days with job security and ignoring the fact that your students are banging their heads against their desks as soon as you leave the room.<br/><br/>Really being good at building strong bridges is a very difficult thing to do, and it's the reason I can only think of three or four teachers who really excelled at doing this from my eight years of high school and college. The best example was Mr. Schmidt, the teacher that I had for World History twice during high school. The man was brilliant. I can't think of a single moment during his classes that I ever asked myself why I was listening to him, because he always told us. His lectures were more than him reciting dates and facts to us with the expectation that we would spew them back to him on test day. Mr. Schmidt made World History relevant to teenage minds. I'm not even sure that he really had a passion for the subject of World History itself...he was just really, really good at building the bridge.

      <h1><a href="/2009/12/07/never-be-a-journalist.html">Never Be a Journalist</a></h1>

        One of my co-workers is a former photo-journalist, and when I was asking him about how he made that work for himself, he said that there was an old saying in journalism: "Never be a journalist: be a specialist." What that means is: find a niche and pursue it. In his case, he marketed himself as a photojournalist specific to the area of Panama in which he was living.<br/><br/>This makes sense for every profession and not just journalism. Most people, when putting together their resume, use the "sheer volume" strategy. They cram as much expertise and experience onto their resume as they can, and then they send it to as many companies and recruiters as they can in the hopes that at least one of them will take notice, feel they're a good match, and give them a call for a job interview.<br/><br/>This is like hunting with a shotgun because you're a poor shot and you're falling back on the spray pattern of the firearm. If you're not accurate in aiming, you're more likely to hit <em>something</em>, yes, but not necessarily the bullseye. Maybe not even the target you were shooting at. I think the reason we have trouble targeting our dream job is because we're so modest and have trouble assessing our own strengths. That, and a lot of people don't really know what they want to do, so they hope a good opportunity will find them. Not a great idea. You might as well aim the gun at your own foot.<br/><br/>Here's another quote that I like but won't expound on: "He never was a person. He was a <em>journalist</em>!" -<em>Almost Famous</em> <br/><br/>Never be a journalist.
