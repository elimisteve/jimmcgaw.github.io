                      My girlfriend's mom had foot surgery a couple of years ago. Her doctor told her, "You should wear nothing but Merrell brand shoes whenever you can. There's nothing better you can put on your feet." So she has four pairs of Merrell shoes that she wears most of the time. She told me about them, and now, I own a pair of them. They're very comfortable for all of the hiking and the walking I...

                      I was talking to my cousin's wife on Christmas. She's an elementary school teacher who just graduated from college and is now on the hunt for her first full-time job. She was telling me about the tactics she used during her student teaching in order to make sure that the kids in her class behaved.One method she used was called "Gimme Five". You say this to their students, and then they're supposed to put up...

                      I read a lot of books; the hard part is finding the good ones. Reading fiction is one thing, because you can just pick a story that sounds entertaining, but I tend to read business books and titles that contains general ideas about the world. I don't know about you, but in an age of an almost unlimited supply of books to read on Amazon.com, I have to use some kind of criteria in order...

                      Back in the early 1990's, some of us played a computer game called "Myst", which was a really more of a series of puzzles tied together around an imaginary world and a loose narrative. Either you played it because you loved games like that, or you were like me, and played it merely because you hadn't discovered the World Wide Web yet. (Actually, the game wasn't that bad; in an era of games like Halo,...

                      I live in a very small city which, according to the official census, only has about 90,000 people in it. There's more than that if you take into account the greater area, but it's still much different than where I originally came from: Detroit. There, in the land of sprawl, you feel lost in a system that's much larger than the community.In downtown Santa Barbara, you start to notice the same homeless people on the...

                      If you're trying to create something that people will use, here's some advice that an aunt gave me a long time ago: "One of the main goals of invention is to make a hard thing easy." That may sound obvious, but at the time, for me, it was not. I had just spent a few hours rigging up a little ramp so that if a person wanted to turn off their alarm, they had to...

                      We have lot of different kinds of crime shows: "Law & Order", "CSI: [insert city here]", "Numb3rs", "Castle", "The Shield"...which each one has a niche that makes it unique, most of these shows tend to follow the same format: episodes open with a crime scene, police officers spend the hour tracking a criminal, and in the end, they put together the puzzle and catch the bad guy. I'm sure detectives sit around in bars with...

                      Oprah once gave every single member of her audience a car, presumably just because she was feeling generous. The scene that it caused in the studio audience, of woman screaming with joy, became a thing of legend. It was very entertaining, and well worth every penny that she spent. (I thought it was funny that later, all those women were surprised to learn that they had to pay taxes on the value of the car....

                      "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" has a pretty terrible name, when you think about it...there must have been a late-night caffeine-fueled session at Unilever where they really tried to think of a good name to position the product relative to butter. As the sun came up and the tequila supply was starting to run out, they threw up their hands and settled on the one idea written on the whiteboard that wasn't terrible. And...

                      When we receive information, we're almost always asking ourselves one question: "Why should I care?"When you're sitting in class listening a professor drone on about the book you were supposed to read the day before, but didn't, you're asking yourself that question. In an era of infinite media and a shortage of attention spans, we all have a "relevancy index" that acts as a barometer to determine how closely we need to listen to what...
