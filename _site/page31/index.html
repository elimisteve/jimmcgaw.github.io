        Orchestras have been experiencing a rapid decline in their attendance in the last few decades. I guess people just don't want to spend their evenings in a stuffy concert hall bored out of their minds. (Who would have thought?)<br /><br />Classical music fans, on the other hand, are quite upset about this. They are the kinds of people who claim that young people these days are stupider than ever, just because, given the choice, they choose not to listen to classical music.<br /><br />I don't know my history very well, but I'm guessing that classical music used to be popular among royalty because having an orchestra full of musicians performing for you was a sign of power. The bigger the orchestra, the more power you appeared to have. Because of this symbol, musicians like Mozart were hired to write symphonies that were to be played by large orchestras.<br /><br />That's it. It had a role in history, and there used to be very few alternatives as far as choices for entertainment. Nothing makes classical music inherently better than any other genre. But it's persisted, so it's regarded as timeless. And because it's perceived as a sacred cow, people fidgeted uncomfortably when the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra decided to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/S-M-Metallica/dp/B00002Z88D/">perform as accompaniment</a> to Metallica at a live show.<br /><br />It's hard to think of a modern heavy metal group like Metallica as "timeless", but as long as there are frustrated, angsty teenagers with access to music and purchasing power (things that only emerged in the last half-century), who can say what's still going to be around one or two hundred years from now?<br /><br />Heck, angsty teenagers wouldn't even need money. I bet there'll be all kinds of Napster clones 50 years from now.

        The hour of New Year's resolutions is almost upon us. There's a trend that happens every year: at the beginning of January, gym memberships and attendance spike up. By February first, the number of people at the gym has fallen back to its normal count.<br /><br />We just can't keep it up for very long. We resolve to do things, but don't follow through for very long. This belies a simple truth: people want to create, but they don't want to maintain. <br /><br />Since New Year's lights a fire under our butts, maybe we shouldn't be trying to alter our behavior in the long term. Instead, why not use the New Year's initiative to do something crazy? Something you've always wanted to do, but couldn't muster up the nerve. Trying speaking in public. Enter a negotiation with your manager at work and see if you can get the upper hand. Break the ice with one of your fears.<br /><br />Maybe just doing it, even once, will make the second and third times easier. And that simple act might change the rest of your year, instead of just the first month.

        Me, if I had to support only one cause, it would be literacy. One of my favorite organizations is <a href="http://www.rfbd.org/">Reading for the Blind and Dylexic</a>. You can sign up to volunteer to read a textbook onto a recording, which is then made available to all members. For those of us without a teaching certificate, it's probably the quickest and easiest way of opening up the avenues of learning to other people in this world.<br /><br />The textbooks are copyrighted material, so the organization is not, understandably, just handing out these memberships to anyone who asks. Before you get access to their materials, you're required to prove that you have a visual impairment of some kind. Otherwise, college students with perfect eyesight across the country would be getting the tapes so they could study without having to actually read the textbook. (I would have slept with them running under my pillow the night before exams.)<br /><br />The recording process is also carefully controlled. If you sign up to volunteer, you go to a recording center, sit in a booth, and read into a microphone. If you're unable to visit a center, you're unable to contribute (as a reader) to the recordings.<br /><br />What surprises me is that they haven't figured out to crowdsource this material yet. Wikipedia is content generated by millions of people around the world. Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection is free to participate. <br /><br />If anyone with a microphone and the ability to produce MP3s was allowed to read books and upload their readings from their home, I would read a lot more books for RFBD. I have a Sony Digital Voice Recorder and a headset, so it would be a cinch for me to produce my own books on tape in an hour or two once a week. I also think there's lots of people in a similar situation as me, with access to similar technology, who would be willing to dictate textbooks onto tape from their homes.<br /><br />Naturally, there are differences between Wikipedia and books on tape. Text is text, so, a few misspellings aside, it's not as though a Wikipedia entry can be terrible. Recordings, on the other hand, can be awful if the levels aren't right, or if there's a lot of background noise. It's impossible to correct errors in the middle of a recording without more advanced software. <br /><br />I could just start reading books I like onto digital recordings and put them online, but I'm pretty sure that would get me sued eventually.<br /><br />RFBD, as an organization, can't do anything to piss off the copyright holders, so for a while, their recording process is likely remain a closed system. I'm willing to bet they've thought of this idea, and are trying to figure out how to crowdsource the recording process remotely, to reduce the use of studio time, without compromising quality.<br /><br />My guess: it'll be done by a different non-profit...one that emerges in the next decade. Recording For the Blind and Dyslexic has a system, and it works. Once upon a time, Blockbuster had a system, and it worked...then along came Netflix.

        I ran around town about six months ago looking for green, unroasted coffee beans. I was a little surprised by how few coffee baristas knew that coffee beans start out green and end up brown only after they've been roasted in large drums. (A couple of these same baristas also shared the story of the origins of Kopi Luwak with me, as a possible explanation for how coffee ends up brown.)<br /><br />I was looking for green coffee beans because I was interested in trying to roast some myself. There are a number of ways you can do this; they all involve merely keeping the beans in motion over heat for ten or twenty minutes and then letting them cool for about twelve hours. I ended up doing mine in a Whirley Pop on the stove, and the results, for a first attempt, were surprisingly drinkable.<br /><br />For those who don't want to mess with a hacked solution at home, you can get good, small drum roasters for coffee online for about $500, which have a reputation for being easy to use and producing good results. For most people, this is too large of an investment just for experimenting.<br /><br />I'm really surprised that nobody's opened a coffee shop that lets people buy a bag of green coffee beans and then roast them with one of these machines. The quality of the resulting roast is irrelevant. Most people probably wouldn't get it right the first time, but it does give people the opportunity to play around with a craft that would otherwise be too expensive to get started doing. <br /><br />I think there's lots of business ideas that could be started around this model. It's not just "do it yourself"...it's offering people an intriguing way to spend an afternoon, and to make something they can call their own.

        ...for the small.<br /><br />What I mean by that: it used to be very, very expensive and costly to follow through on bad ideas. Now, you don't need to be sure you have a great idea before you start testing it out. Now, you can do a lot for little monetary cost and see if any mud sticks to the wall.<br /><br />Musical idea? Don't write an album and try to get a record company to distribute it for you. Write one song and throw it up on MySpace.<br /><br />Something you want to write? Don't spend weeks writing a book and then shop around for a publisher. Start blogging it one day at a time.<br /><br />I'm not the most authoritative person in the world, so in the realm of film, I'll defer to the advice that Quentin Tarantino offers to aspiring directors. To paraphrase: if you want to be a film director, go get a camera and some people and start filming a story. Once you've done that, then you're a director. The only issue that remains at that point is how much money you'll get in exchange for your time spent, which is either matter of imagination or negotiation on your part.<br /><br />"Bad" ideas come with inherently more risk, so in the past, they were less valuable. With the "publish, then filter" model of the Internet, trade-off shifted. You might still waste time, but it doesn't have to be a lot of time, and it certainly costs less money than ever before...sometimes it's $0. That's your opportunity.

        When you're working on a project over time, you never know for sure if you're on the track. Most people in that situation, looking for feedback, look for the stark raving fans that sing praise of their idea. <br /><br />Me, I think you know you're on the right track when you start getting noisy detractors. Not trolls, but people who make passionate statements about why what you're doing is wrong, or why it won't work, or why you're wasting your time.<br /><br />Before Howard Schultz came along, the owners of Starbucks felt that getting into the coffee bar business was a bad idea. Coffee is supposed to be made in the home, they felt, and the concept of opening a location that served coffee by the cup seemed silly to them.<br /><br />If everyone who hears your idea is comfortable with it, then it's not an idea, it's an imitation. Some discomfort or dissent is probably a good omen.

        Recently, I offered to help a local non-profit organization with an overhaul of their website. I find pro-bono work to be a decent way of getting experience dealing with people. I think of them as practice runs for situations in which I'll be acting as a technical consultant.<br /><br />When I first went into their office a few months ago, I met with four people in the organization, who politely introduced themselves to me. When my turn came, I opened by telling them:<br /><br />"I know that as an organization dedicated to helping struggling families, you are doing a lot of hard work with very, very little, every day. And I just want to start by thanking you for everything you do."<br /><br />It was one thing for me to say it, but the reason it worked so well is because I sincerely <em>meant</em> it. It would be easy for me, as a volunteer helping with their website, to overvalue my contribution to their efforts, but I know better. I'm not doing the hard work...they are. And because I see things that way, it allowed me to be honest.<br /><br />Whenever I can do it sincerely, I try to start or end every meeting by thanking people for all of their hard work. Fortunately for me, I get to say it and mean it very often, because I'm surrounded by smart people who really <em>are</em> hard workers. If you can start a meeting with gratitude, and truly mean what you say, it gets things off on the right foot, and it makes everything that comes after easier to deal with.

        In the movie <em>The Devil's Advocate</em>, Keanu Reeves is recruited to work at for Al Pacino. Both of them are practicing trial lawyers. Towards the end, when Pacino's character's true identity has been revealed as that of Satan incarnate, Reeves asks him regarding their chosen profession, "Why the law?"<br /><br />Pacino replies, "Because the law, my boy, puts us into everything. It's the ultimate backstage pass, it's the new priesthood, baby."<br /><br />In this case, the devil is wrong. (If anyone is delegated power in the legal sphere, it's the lawmakers, not the lawyers.) But I think if the devil were among us today, in a nation of free enterprise, he would be a marketer.<br /><br />Marketing isn't just advertising; it encompasses much more than that. It has the potential to influence human behavior. It made a generation of people start smoking, made millions of people in Texas stop littering, and started a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo">Internet meme against United Airlines</a>. <br /><br />The serpent in the Garden tempted Eve with an apple. Eve caved. As the story goes, the resulting windfall got us all into the mess we're in. If the devil is among us today, he's almost certainly running pyramid schemes, grifting senior citizens out of their life savings, and taking advantage of the frailties of human judgment.<br /><br />If you are a marketer (and each one of is, every day), then you are responsible for the consequences of what you market. You're responsible for the products people buy and the ideas you spread. If you don't like the possible nature of those consequences, don't market them.<br /><br />Unless, of course, you want to play devil's advocate and blame free will.

        I can say that about him on here, because he hates the Internet (he once called it a "bunch of noise"), so I'm pretty sure he'll never read this. <br /><br />The author of the dystopian <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> once stood up to discuss the book in an auditorium full of students. He tried to explain to them that the main theme of his book was about the evils of television. The students insisted, repeatedly, that the book wasn't about television but about government censorship. They told him he didn't know the meaning buried in the book he had written himself.<br /><br />Frustrated, he walked off the stage in the middle of the discussion.<br /><br />Ray Bradbury is wrong, but not because he's wrong about his own book...he knows full well what he wrote it about, better than any of those students he was speaking to. But collectively, readers drew a different conclusion. The message they received didn't quite match the one that Bradbury was trying to send.<br /><br />This isn't the fault of the readers; it's the fault of the author. The audience sees what it wants to see. If the artist paints a picture of what he thinks is a cow, but most spectators see a horse, then it might as well be a horse. If the artist has a problem with this, he should paint another picture...one that more closely resembles a horse. Whining about how it's a cow won't make it so in the minds of the readers. <br /><br />Any work of art stands alone in the minds of the viewers...it shouldn't require the artist to stand by and explain it. (This is why DVD commentaries can't salvage David Lynch's films.) Bradbury tried to say one thing, and since most people didn't hear him say it, he's welcome to try writing a different book.
