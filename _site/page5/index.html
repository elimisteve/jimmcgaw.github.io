                      A few days ago I was having a conversation about the process of selling a house. I'm not a homeowner, but I was curious: if you're going to make cosmetic improvements before putting it on the market, in the hopes you can get a higher selling price, where does it make the most sense to invest? (While it depends on the property, the general answer is kitchen and bathrooms.)The discussion came around to those little...

                      I mentioned a couple of months ago that I set out to read a book a day in 2016. I've fallen woefully short of this&nbsp;nigh-impossible goal&nbsp;so far, but my real aim has been to spend as much of my free time reading as I can&nbsp;manage. It has served well to help me manage my time, and keep me away from things that I might otherwise let distract me.I am trying to approach works of fiction...

                      During World War II, there was a massive influx of black people into the city of Detroit. This occurred because the city (which earned the nickname "the Arsenal of Democracy") had become a booming production center for supplies for the war effort overseas. The labor force needed supplementing, and there were plenty of minority workers who easily filled these roles.After the war ended, so did the existence of these jobs. The multitudes of people who...

                      You often hear the complaint that people of various religious stripes forsake this life because they are so focused on a life that supposedly comes after this one. They don't make the most of their time on earth because they feel that they'll enter the life that truly matters after they die. This is usually attributed to weakness; people who are incapable of handling the sorrows or pain of this world can easily escape it...

                      "It's judgment that defeats us." -Colonel Kurtz, Apocalypse NowThis line from the film resonated with me intensely the first time I saw it many years ago. What it truly meant in the context of the film was lost on me at the time; I was far too young to appreciate what it contributed to the movie's narrative. With wiser eyes, I'll have to watch it again. But this quote stood alone as containing some important...

                      The question occurs to me more often on days when I'm immersed in an environment of younger people. Amongst high schoolers and college students, talking about their passions and the marks they intend to leave on the world, my perspective on myself comes into focus, and I see that I'm markedly different than most of them.In getting a little older, I haven't lost my enthusiasm for life; this happens to a lot of people as...

                      There's a common phrase, which gained widespread use on the Internet, that people use when they're complaining about a problem: first-world problems. It's used by the speaker to concede that what they're complaining about is only a problem when considered in a given context, and where the context itself indicates that the problem itself is trivial.&nbsp;Having to wait in line for a long time at the grocery store is a first-world problem, since it's not...

                      Recently, I wrote that nothing tells you more about a person than how they choose to divide people. Sometimes this is done on the basis on wealth, status, popularity, race, gender, choice of religion, or a variety of other factors. Usually it's a combination thereof.This might make people curious: how do I, personally, choose to divide people? This is a fair question; as much as I like to talk in the abstract on here about...

                      "Though it cost all you have, get understanding." -Proverbs 4:7I've spent the last couple of months trying to get to the heart of who I really am. This is a difficult journey for anyone. In this relatively short (albeit intense) period of time, I've come to a simple truth. The cornerstone of my own psychopathology is this: I'm ashamed to be a male. This has caused difficulty in my relationships.It's eloquent in its simplicity.&nbsp;I'm a...

                      This is a rallying cry you hear quite often: that we need more women to enter technology-related fields. I made a joke about this a couple of years ago on Twitter. Naturally, I was just being silly on there; I personally have&nbsp;no problem&nbsp;with more women entering the field...but pushing for women in tech, as an endgame, seems arbitrary, and can definitely be&nbsp;problematic in its own right.I recognize this as being a massive problem. Women are...
