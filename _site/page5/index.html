        I mentioned a couple of months ago that I set out to read a book a day in 2016. I've fallen woefully short of this&nbsp;nigh-impossible goal&nbsp;so far, but my real aim has been to spend as much of my free time reading as I can&nbsp;manage. It has served well to help me manage my time, and keep me away from things that I might otherwise let distract me.<br /><br />I am trying to approach works of fiction with an open mind. I almost always read non-fiction; I read to learn, not to be entertained. I'm beginning to appreciate the transformative power of narrative when it's expressed in words and not flitting images on a television screen.<br /><br />When I was a freshman in college, I remember being interested in sociology; I was drawn towards it because I wanted to help people, but more importantly, because I wanted to understand the world. I had a lot of trouble reading sociology texts and grasping their lessons about the world at large, so in the end, I turned away from this major and instead got myself a trade.<br /><br />I tried so hard in my youth to understand the world, because I recognized that it was full of problems, and I wanted to help it. Much later on, I settled for merely trying to understand and help the people in the community around me. Eventually, when I found I struggled to do that, I moved on to trying to understand my close friends, acquaintances, and family, because I wanted to deepen my relationships with them, but I'm not sure that I did a good job of that either.<br /><br />Among the non-fiction I'm consuming these days, I'm reading a lot of psychology books written for the masses. While I've dabbled in this genre in the past, I did so with the hope of understanding people around me. I'm finding it more instructive to apply the lessons I'm reading to my own brain.<br /><br />So in the end, I've been driven to understand the one thing that's been staring me in the face the entire time, which I've done a great job of ignoring: myself. That's becoming clearer by the day. It's too early for me to say for sure, but I get the sense that once I understand myself, there's a chance that I just might grow to understand the other people in my life. Maybe I'll eventually understand the larger forces at play in my community. And far off in the distance, there's a slight, <i>very</i>&nbsp;slight, chance that one day I'll even understand&nbsp;the world.

        During World War II, there was a massive influx of black people into the city of Detroit. This occurred because the city (which earned the nickname "the Arsenal of Democracy") had become a booming production center for supplies for the war effort overseas. The labor force needed supplementing, and there were plenty of minority workers who easily filled these roles.<br /><br />After the war ended, so did the existence of these jobs. The multitudes of people who filled these were turned loose into the city, without enough work to support themselves. This didn't just affect the black people who had these jobs, but they're the ones who found themselves in a large city where they were systematically discriminated against. Employers were slower to hire them. Landlords were able to act as slumlords. 10 years before <i>Brown v Board</i>, society at large was still decades away from giving them basic human rights.<br /><br />If you look at the network of highway systems in Detroit, you'll see they flow around the city in a byzantine fashion, slithering around in directions that a city planner wouldn't necessarily choose for logical reasons. The reason was practical at the time for those in control: the routes were planned so as to maximize the amount of "poor" housing that was removed. In a city where there was barely enough housing for all of the blacks that needed it, the city took pains to destroy as much housing that was available to them, while minimizing the impact the construction efforts had on the housing of their white counterparts.<br /><br />The riots that broke out in Detroit in 1967 merely represented the boiling over of this conflict. After two decades of structural violence, something finally gave, and the result was literal violence. The migration of people from the city to the suburbs had been happening before the riots; the numbers increased dramatically in response to them. It wasn't just the white people who fled the city; anyone who could afford to relocate to the suburbs did so, but the people who were able to move out of Detroit proper were, demographically, almost entirely white.<br /><br />And so began Detroit's slow and steady decline. As suburban municipalities established themselves around Detroit, people with the financial means moved into them. These suburbs were fiscally independent of Detroit. Even though many residents commuted into the city for work, the property taxes they paid on housing went to the suburbs, instead of the inner city whose infrastructure was being strained by the commuters and businesses who used it. Money flowed out, and the public utilities and services of Detroit became more and more difficult to support in the face of a decreasing population and radically shrinking tax revenue base. The Motor City, so famous for its automobiles, gave commuters mobility that previous generations had never known; In doing so, it disseminated the tool of its own destruction.<br /><br />This isn't just the story of Detroit; it is the story of many large American metropolitan areas. As the civil rights movement progressed, overt racism became more covert, and people fled from the inner cities to the suburbs. As minorities became gradually more empowered, they started moving into the suburbs themselves; in response to this, white people moved into suburbs even further removed from the city.<br /><br />I was born in 1982 in Southfield, Michigan. In my youth, I attended an elementary school that was quite a healthy mix of whites and blacks. When I was 10 years old, in response to falling property values in Southfield and in search of a better public school system for me and my brother, my parents moved to the city of Troy, a town which, if it had been any whiter, would have been transparent. I don't believe my parents are racist, but that this move was based on more general, latent racial tensions that were manifesting themselves in the community at the time cannot be denied. My parents were acting to give me the best chance at the best possible future; demographics were a causal factor. My own story is representative of that of many others at the time.<br /><br />My parents did get me into an exceptionally good high school, and largely as a result of this, I managed to attend a good university. I emerged from college with a degree and worked in the larger Detroit area for the next four years. Finding my first job was difficult; many years later, economists would say that Detroit had been in a recession since around the time I graduated.<br /><br />After a few years of this, in search of professional and personal growth, I ended up taking a job in California and moving out there. My parents remained behind in the Detroit area. While they were outwardly supportive of what I wanted to do, parents never like to see their kids move a couple thousand miles away. Many of my friends the same age have done exactly the same thing; indeed, I have few high school and college friends who have stayed in Michigan.<br /><br />It's a mistake to believe that suburbs are somehow independent and unaffected by the problems of their respective inner cities. Located so close geographically, and economically intertwined so intimately, the decay of the cities spreads slowly but surely into the outlying areas. You hear parents complain that their children, with increased options of mobility in their careers, are running away from the suburbs of their youth to other areas of the country that are less affected by these problems. Or, at the other extreme, the economic problems themselves are forcing children in their twenties and thirties to move back in with their parents.<br /><br />The story here is essentially the tragedy of the commons. Maintaining unity among the residents of Detroit, and preserving the system of the city at large, in the days following World War II was no one person's problem. With each acting in their own self-interest, the city crumbled. The people of these generations that had the power to do so never solved the problems; they merely <i>ran from them</i>. As so often happens in life, if you do this, the problems will catch up with you sooner or later. You reap what you sow.<br /><br />My father often drops a not-so-subtle, ever hopeful hint that the economy of Detroit is coming back, driven by an increasing presence of startups and entrepreneurs, and that I could probably find a job there if I wanted to. For the time being, he's correct; I have options, and that's most certainly one of them. And I certainly can try to romanticize the notion of returning to the city of my grandparent's youth and allow my efforts to contribute to its revitalization. But therein lies one of the big problems: it's the city of my <i>grandparents</i>.&nbsp;I'm a generation removed from any memory of former glory, any feeling of nostalgia, that might compel me to return and help.<br /><br />Last I heard, there is a large population of hipsters who have set up residence, and are trying to create a burgeoning culture, within Detroit. Much of this is centered in Midtown or in the so-called "Cass Corridor". I don't know much about these areas or the motivations of the people living in them. I'm not sure how much the presence of hipsters in scattered pockets within Detroit is doing to emulsify the culture of the suburbs with the culture of Detroit. I suspect their presence helps more than not, and that their hearts are in the right place.<br /><br />At my last job in Detroit (actually, Madison Heights), I remember the receptionist at the front desk. She was a kindly, elderly black lady with a heart of gold and a charming smile, and it was a delight to have her greeting me every day when I walked in. The last thing she said to me, before I walked out and moved out to California, was a simple request masked carefully as a statement by its intonation: "I know that, wherever you go, you'll always speak fondly of Detroit."<br /><br />Detroit isn't an easy problem, so I haven't always done as she asked. But I'm trying.

        You often hear the complaint that people of various religious stripes forsake this life because they are so focused on a life that supposedly comes after this one. They don't make the most of their time on earth because they feel that they'll enter the life that truly matters after they die. This is usually attributed to weakness; people who are incapable of handling the sorrows or pain of this world can easily escape it by setting their sights on life after death.<br /><br />Can't hack it in this world? Start living for the next one! In a world of televangelists, it's wholly appropriate to summarize this characteristic of the religious in the language of an infomercial.<br /><br />While I study religious scripture, I haven't yet found a reason to eschew living life in this world to its fullest in the hopes that it will afford me a better life after I die. There are plenty of good reasons for self-negation, but hoping that you'll be rewarded for it post-mortem isn't one I subscribe to. Perhaps the religious critics are correct...people who are religious are merely spiteful, and looking for a justification for despising this world and the people in it.<br /><br />Yet, after all my experience with people around this country, I keep wondering: religious people are so often resigned to helplessness, since they've come to despise human nature. The non-religious or anti-religious are not only free of this sense of helplessness, but they also adamantly believe that our time in this life is the only time we get; why, then, do they seem to do so little with it?

        "It's judgment that defeats us." -Colonel Kurtz, <i>Apocalypse Now</i><br /><i><br /></i>This line from the film resonated with me intensely the first time I saw it many years ago. What it truly meant in the context of the film was lost on me at the time; I was far too young to appreciate what it contributed to the movie's narrative. With wiser eyes, I'll have to watch it again. But this quote stood alone as containing some important truth.<br /><br />I recognize now why it stuck with me, and why I adopted it as a mantra for a time. Judgment is an easy way to insulate yourself, to stave off a sense of vulnerability. You might feel yourself feel annoyed, sad, happy, guilty, any number of genuine human emotions. It's very easy for us to judge ourselves for feeling them.<br /><br />We all do this. We realize we're feeling sad about something, but perhaps, for some irrational reason, we believe that we <i>shouldn't</i>&nbsp;feel that way. You can dismiss the validity of feeling any emotion by comparing yourself to another person. Maybe it makes no sense to feel sad, maybe you feel guilty feeling sad, because you can find someone else in your life who has more reasons to feel sad. Maybe we feel happy, but we don't think we <i>should</i>&nbsp;feel happy because a friend of ours who spoke with earlier is having a bad day, and we want to shoulder their unhappiness. Some&nbsp;feeling enters your heart, and you find some reason to rationalize rejecting it as inappropriate, and you cut it off.<br /><br />This is how we stifle our own humanity. Thus far, I haven't been able to avoid making this mistake; I've made it frequently.&nbsp;We do it to insulate ourselves.&nbsp;We do it to spare ourselves pain in the short-term, or out of a misplaced sense of stoicism...but the chickens always come home to roost in the end. When we feel healthy emotions, but choose to judge them and suppress them instead of letting them flow through us, then we're choosing to lie down in defeat.

        The question occurs to me more often on days when I'm immersed in an environment of younger people.

      <h1><a href="/2016/04/08/first-world-problems.html">First-World Problems</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Apr 8, 2016</span>

      <div class="content">
        There's a common phrase, which gained widespread use on the Internet, that people use when they're complaining about a problem: <i>first-world problems</i>. It's used by the speaker to concede that what they're complaining about is only a problem when considered in a given context, and where the context itself indicates that the problem itself is trivial.&nbsp;Having to wait in line for a long time at the grocery store is a first-world problem, since it's not really an inconvenience if you consider that many people are unable to afford food for themselves, or that many people lack&nbsp;<i>access to food</i>&nbsp;altogether.<br /><br />So what does this mean? We've come to an age in history where there's a general awareness among the privileged that the problems among the privileged are readily known, acknowledged, and accepted as being trivial problems on a global scale. We verbally state it to one another in conversation. You'll frequently see this phrase as a hashtag in social media. From a cultural standpoint, this is pretty amazing. The term "first-world" didn't exist 100 years ago, but I'm willing to bet that the wealthy at that time would never have acknowledged that their gripes were petty by tagging them with #oldmoneyissues.<br /><br />But does the existence and prevalence of this Internet meme in casual, everyday conversation among the privileged actually spawn social change? Does our increased awareness of our privilege and the plight of the less fortunate lead us to change our actions? That's difficult to say; perhaps people do catch themselves punctuating a complaint about something insignificant by saying, "But that's a first-world problem", then go home and do something to address the more significant problem, say, by donating to a food bank.<br /><br />More likely, I'd guess this is just a psychological trick people use to give themselves license to "white whine". Complaining feels good, and it's very easy to do. This phrase has instilled itself into our culture because it assuages privileged guilt. We all want to complain, but none of us want to be seen as complainers. Tacking on this phrase gives us a trapdoor.<br /><br />A few years ago, I made some effort to put this into practice in a different way. If a complaint arose in my head, and I had the urge to vocalize it, I'd first consider whether or not it was something that might be deemed a first-world problem. If it was, I wouldn't vocalize it, and I tried to trace the source of the complaint in my head to get rid of it. I wanted it use this awareness to trigger real change within me.<br /><br />This was very difficult at first. I discovered that, more often than not, a complaint about something that doesn't matter would escape from my lips before I even realized that what I was saying was a complaint. Even now, this will sometimes still happen if I get nervous talking to someone. But over time, I started to recognize the trains of thought that led to these complaints, and to cut them off before they became fully formed ideas in my head.<br /><br />I learned that you can turn just about every petty complaint upside down and make it an expression of gratitude. I'm grateful that I have enough to eat. I'm grateful that I'm literate. I'm grateful that I have a job. While I typically keep these thoughts to myself, I also quickly learned that many people perceive you as boring or as a pollyanna if you vocalize these things instead of complaints. So it goes; I'm grateful that I can choose to be the kind of person I want to be, even if it isn't always acceptable to others.<br /><br />And yes, the irony is not lost on me...the #firstworldproblems hashtag problem is, in and of itself, a first-world problem.

        Recently, I <a href="/2016/02/24/the-weak.html">wrote</a> that nothing tells you more about a person than how they choose to divide people. Sometimes this is done on the basis on wealth, status, popularity, race, gender, choice of religion, or a variety of other factors. Usually it's a combination thereof.<br /><br />This might make people curious: how do I, personally, choose to divide people? This is a fair question; as much as I like to talk in the abstract on here about moral or ethical principles, I don't always elaborate on the experiences that led me to my conclusions, or discuss how I apply them to my own life.<br /><br />To me, there are people who are aware of their own ignorance, and seek knowledge. There are those who are aware of their own prejudices, and seek experiences and understanding that will allow them to empathize with the targets of their prejudices. There are those who possess an awareness of their past mistakes, and thus their capacity to make future mistakes, and who attempt to learn from them so as to avoid repeating them. There are people who lack awareness these kinds of things, but are actively striving to <i>become</i>&nbsp;aware.<br /><br />Then there's everyone else.

        "Though it cost all you have, get understanding." -Proverbs 4:7<br /><br />I've spent the last couple of months trying to get to the heart of who I really am. This is a difficult journey for anyone. In this relatively short (albeit intense) period of time, I've come to a simple truth. The cornerstone of my own psychopathology is this: I'm ashamed to be a male. This has caused difficulty in my relationships.<br /><br />It's eloquent in its simplicity.&nbsp;<i>I'm a man. I want a woman. Men always hurt women.&nbsp;</i><i>If I get a woman, I will hurt her.</i><i>&nbsp;I don't want to hurt anyone.&nbsp;</i>This is the source of my own inner conflict. It's a logical fallacy for many reasons, and intellectually, I can accept that now. But admitting this out loud isn't enough. This is a feeling of truth that I've internalized deep inside of my heart and my head, and I learned it when I was very young. It's going to take me a lot of time and effort to truly unlearn it. (How I came to learn this is a long, complicated, and pretty boring story, so I'll skip those details.)<br /><br />I carried this with me into my adolescence, and while I longed to be close with a girl, I never could quite bridge the gap completely. I remember being in high school and going after a couple of girls. More often, they chose to pursue me. The end was always the same: when the critical moment came for me to make a decision, to be the guy and make a move, I simply froze. I couldn't bring myself to move forward. The deep seated feeling, at my core, was that if I moved any closer, I'd end up hurting the girl.<br /><br />Is this actually true about myself? Would I actually hurt every girl I try to get close to? Of course not. I'm not an evil person with evil intentions. I was merely applying black and white thinking to a simple fact of life: that getting close to&nbsp;<i>anyone</i>&nbsp;will eventually result in some pain for both people. But in life, while pain inevitably goes with the territory of any relationship, this pain is always overshadowed by the benefits of the relationship itself. Intimacy with another human being, romantic or otherwise, does cause suffering, but we accept this because we value the other aspects of the relationship much more.<br /><br />I see clearly now that this has determined how things have played out between me and every girl who's ever been willing to&nbsp;<i>try</i>&nbsp;and get close to me. In those moments of shared vulnerability, it always struck me that not only could I be hurt, but more importantly, that I possessed the terrible capacity to&nbsp;<i>hurt her</i>. I saw the latter as the only possible end in every one of these situations. In response to recognizing this, I've always turned and fled before things could go any further.<br /><br />I remember being at a dance at the start of 10th grade, and a girl I knew approached me, wanting to dance. We talked and joked around for a while, and we danced to the upbeat songs. At the end of the night, when the slow dance was closing things down, we stood there staring at each other. As my friends danced in pairs around me, I stood petrified. I couldn't bring myself to reach out to her. At the end of the night, we left the venue in silence, and she simply went her way and I went mine.<br /><br />One might think that I just trying to avoid getting hurt myself; this is only a partial truth, at best. Much more, I always feared the guilt that would result from inevitably result from <i>me</i>&nbsp;hurting <i>them</i>. But avoidance of being hurt, and avoiding the potential&nbsp;<i>guilt</i> of hurting someone else, both stem from the self-interest of avoiding some kind of pain. So perhaps the difference is negligible.<br /><br />In my case, I know that it's possible for a person to feel something so strongly and so deeply that self-interest leads to self-sacrifice.<br /><br />It's incorrect to believe that any incidence of pain in a relationship nullifies the value of the <i>entire</i> relationship, but it's also diminutive of me to have believed that I always needed to be the one <i>protecting the girl</i>. I've always felt I had to run away, to fall on my sword, in order to to prevent me causing her any hurt. In my naiveté, I've consistently failed to see the girl as a person capable of managing her own feelings, taking her own risks, and letting her decide for herself when she needed protecting. My <i>hamartia</i> is indeed pride.<br /><br />The most horrifying thing is that this has invariably been a self-fulfilling prophecy. In letting things build to the point where we're both vulnerable, and then fleeing before a relationship could be established, I really did end up hurting the girl. In every situation, that ended up being the extent of what was shared. We'd draw close together, and I'd offer only rejection. In trying to avoid doing what I feared I would do, it ended up being the only thing that I ever managed to do.<br /><br />All of this dawned on me slowly a few days ago. I drove to the mountains and introspected to see if there was any truth in this. The tears came slowly, but when they did, I wept bitterly, and I recognized them to be those tears that only accompany truth. The seemingly haphazard actions I've taken in my life, the hazy motivations that have driven them, and all the events that have resulted, could suddenly be tied together by this one common thread.<br /><br />I can say this: these kinds of revelations are&nbsp;<i>never</i>&nbsp;as dramatic as we might like them to be. We hope that clarity will come into our lives like a grandiose Hollywood production. We imagine theatrical singing and dancing, and all manner of explosions. Somehow we think that getting to the heart of the matters that matter most will upset every fiber of our being. But it's more like sitting outside, in tranquility, and a small sparrow lands on your leg. It sits there and watches you in silence for a time, then it offers you a short birdsong. Once it feels that you've gotten its message, it flies off. You watch it fly out of your sight, and then go back to the undisturbed tranquility. A little while later, you notice that it has crapped on you.<br /><br />I was in a 12 year relationship with a girl that ended in the middle of last year. She told me simply: I want children. Knowing I didn't really want children, she knew this would put me to a decision. What she was really saying is that she needed a commitment from me. In a situation where I care about the other person, especially as much as I cared about her, the whole thing scared me. Commitment, marriage, all of that, it only translated to one thing for me. &nbsp;To me it could only mean&nbsp;<i>I'm going to hurt someone</i>. This was a long relationship, so I know that we cared about each other, and I know that we loved each other. Despite that, fearing inevitable destruction, I preemptively destroyed. Fundamentally, I felt I had to eliminate the relationship before children came into it; I couldn't spare either of us the pain of separating, but I had to spare <i>them</i> the pain that would come with our union.<br /><br />Then I decided to pursue another girl...one with whom I felt I shared more common ground. The manner in which I did it was well-intentioned but ignorant, and as a result of my mistakes, she not only rejected me, but sent me a clear message that roughly said, <i>I am afraid of you. Get out of my life forever and never return</i>. Now I understand that this outcome hurt me as badly as it did not because I'm incapable of handling rejection, but because it tore open my deepest wound. It confirmed my worst fear: <i>try and get close to a girl, and you'll only hurt her</i>.<br /><br />Why am I sharing this? Because if this is true for me, then someone else out there is feeling it too. I always hope that what I write reaches someone else who needs to read it. I'm not alone, and if what I'm writing about myself here resonates with you, then neither are you. I hope I can articulate in words what someone else is struggling to express about themselves. I owe almost everything that I know to other people who have put what <i>they</i>&nbsp;know into words, and who have had the courage to share them. If you can, avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />My experiences have made me into who I am; the experiences of no two people are the same. What we see, feel, and learn shapes our perspectives. We all get molded into a completely unique person, and this makes us capable of accomplishing something that no one else can. The only pertinent question for me now is how I move forward. If the rule that I followed has led me down this path, where am I meant to go next?

        This is a rallying cry you hear quite often: that we need more women to enter technology-related fields. I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/Jim_McGaw/status/484382117963370496" target="_blank">joke about this</a> a couple of years ago on Twitter. Naturally, I was just being silly on there; I personally have&nbsp;<i>no problem</i>&nbsp;with more women entering the field...but pushing for women in tech, as an endgame, seems arbitrary, and can definitely be&nbsp;<a href="http://pensieve.verou.me/post/54853162595/on-women-in-tech" target="_blank">problematic in its own right</a>.<br /><br />I recognize this as being a massive problem. Women are chronically underrepresented in the so-called STEM fields, which are Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. Because I'm a software developer, and I've been active in this field for the last 10 years, I'm going to make that the focus of this post.<br /><br />Occasionally, you see campaigns on Kickstarter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/369073015/roominate-rpower-control-smart-building-toys-with" target="_blank">like this one</a>, that are designed to engage and interest young girls in technology-related fields. The question arises: how much responsibility do we, as a society, have for&nbsp;<i>actively pushing young women</i>&nbsp;towards careers in programming? How much should parents be doing to push their daughters to explore career paths that defy the gender stereotypes? How much effort and resources should the educational system expend trying to address this?<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea how to answer these kinds of questions. At first glance, I'd fall back on my own limited knowledge and say, "Not nearly enough." And that's probably true. As a society, I don't believe we do enough to encourage young people with unique interests or gifts to explore them, particularly when they fall outside of generally accepted cultural norms. Gender stereotypes play a role.<br /><br />But I don't think it makes much sense to start discussing this part of the issue, and its myriad nuances, until you address the <i>real</i>&nbsp;problem that exists downstream: attrition. Namely, women who enter programming fields usually don't stick around.<br /><br />Why? Do some <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=women+in+technology+exclusionary" target="_blank">Googling</a>, and you will find that what women encounter after they've entered programming fields in their workplaces and the surrounding culture is an&nbsp;<a href="http://rachelappel.com/stats-data-and-answers-as-to-why-there-are-so-few-women-in-technology-fields/" target="_blank">extremely</a> <a href="http://motto.time.com/4226297/silicon-valley-gender-discrimination-data-elephant-in-the-valley/" target="_blank">serious</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/08/sexism-silicon-valley-women" target="_blank">problem</a>.<br /><br />As a male in a male-dominated profession, I cannot pretend to understand this problem. I'll offer this: my first job out of college was as a corporate accountant at a small manufacturing concern in Detroit. While both of the people I reported to were male, the rest of the department, with one exception, was a cubicle sea populated entirely by women, most of whom were at least 10 years older than me. I'm the kind of person who struggles to find common ground for conversation even amongst people who share my interests. While this problem gradually abated as I grew through my 20's, the early years I spent at this company felt isolating. People were certainly friendly; in hindsight, it was a warm and welcoming environment that I happened to luck into. But I struggled to feel comfortable in group settings. It wasn't a job where I ever managed to feel like I had found my place, socially speaking.<br /><br />The comparisons here are weak, at best. The issue of women in technology is based on exclusion, on being made to feel ashamed of, or actively rejected because of, who you are. That's the problem I believe women encounter in technology workplaces. I <i>never</i> felt this way in my first job. The frequent awkward silences dropping between me and others, and the lack of a sense of belonging, might have made me feel <i>uncomfortable</i>, but it doesn't equal discrimination. If anything at all, it gives me a slight appreciation for what it means to view things with a sense that you're on the social periphery. I've tried to carry this with me since then.<br /><br />My first few programming jobs were at smaller companies, usually around a dozen people or so. I was surrounded by people who were roughly my age, and who all shared an active interest in the thing that I love to do most: <i>write dat code</i>. We all wanted to <i>build the things</i>&nbsp;for people; this was a wonderful switch from my first job, where I just crunched the numbers on behalf of the people who were actually building the things.<br /><br />My first programming job at a larger company, with an engineering department numbering in the dozens, truly was a shock by comparison. In a company this big, an inevitable social phenomenon arises: the <i>clique</i>. I'm not a big fan of the clique. I prefer to engage and connect with people as individuals. When I come across a group, I'm more interested in listening to what each individual is contributing, and watching the conversational ball bounce around between people. I'd guess that anyone watching me from afar would see my head dart around the group the way a cat's head does when it's stalking a laser pointer dot.<br /><br />Part of this is just plain old nervousness. But I'm also the kind of person who prefers to slink elusively between groups, largely to maintain my ability to see all the individuals for who they are and not as a member of this group or that one. It also helps me keep perspective on the larger context in which all of these cliques exist. I eschew joining any clique on a sustained basis simply because cliques can be, by their very nature, exclusionary. They are <i>natural</i>, and yes, in large settings they are most certainly <i>necessary</i>, but I fear their unintended consequences.<br /><br />Fortunately, I don't think I've ever been at a company where I witnessed <i>active</i>&nbsp;discrimination against women, or even subtle comments that could have been considered exclusionary. I've never had to stand up to anything that I considered to be wrong. Truthfully, stating this fact in writing just makes me hope that I haven't missed any opportunity to do so; it's so much easier to remain silent and scrub your memory after the fact.<br /><br />What I've tried to do then, on some level that exists below my conscious awareness, is to avoid the risk that I'll somehow <i>passively</i>&nbsp;contribute to the problem. I've worked among many groups of programmers before, and yes, they're almost always all men. The problem is simple: when a group of all men (or all women) congeals, certain types of discussions naturally emerge from these groups. I'm not sure you can avoid this. The behavior that emerges is far from the extreme of the "brogrammer" stereotype, but when people fall into these groups, they naturally adapt certain conversational topics and rhythms. These patterns become habits, and they carry over into other contexts in which not all of the people present are men.<br /><br />As computer programmers, we are <i>not</i>&nbsp;being mindful with enough vigilance about what we are saying.<br /><br />So, in any setting related to my profession, I remain on the fringes, occasionally sticking my head up and offering some question, insight, or dumb joke. The downside is that people might come to see you as cold and aloof (which I can be), or they believe that you're not a team player (which I am). And not <i>everyone</i>&nbsp;can do this; in normal group dynamics, someone has to take charge and lead the conversation to make stuff happen.<br /><br />So what are we to do? I decided to write this post because I recently read Jimmy Carter's book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Call-Action-Women-Religion-Violence/dp/1476773963/" target="_blank">A Call to Action</a></i>. In it, Mr. Carter talks about how women worldwide are oppressed, and the acts of violence that are committed against them, in cultures where this is acceptable, overlooked by legal systems, and often justified by religious scripture. Many of the stories in this book shook me to the core; there were parts of it that I had trouble reading.<br /><br />After the fact, I still have trouble accepting that the injustices that happen against women are as pervasive and as severe as they are. Is the human race still this daft? Women comprise <i>half of the population</i>.&nbsp;In the book, Mr. Carter mentions that men should not just be turning a blind eye to this kind of thing because we're not affected by it; we should <i>do something</i>. This resonated with me, and I'm still considering how I, given my particular skills, could contribute to this fight.<br /><br />This is difficult, because I'm skilled as a computer programmer, and I tend to work best independently; I have no idea what you can or should do in order to bring about social change on a larger scale. The only thing I've come to so far is that I can bring the fight to where I am. We can all do this.<br /><br />If you work in technology, or any STEM field,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Call-Action-Women-Religion-Violence/dp/1476773963/" target="_blank">go read Carter's book</a>. Perhaps this will sensitize us to the issue. Recommend or give a copy of it to your sexist boss or co-worker, if you have one. He doesn't talk about discrimination against women in technology in particular, but the examples of violence against women are awful enough that it will jar your awareness of the horrors of this kind of discrimination to the surface of your conscious mind. I'd like to say that I know we're better than this, but we're not. I know we can be.

      <div class="content">
        In the early days, when I first started writing on here, I believed that a blog was meant to be something impersonal. I tried to leave the focus on my ideas, to make the content of what I saying center stage, and only to refer to myself to the extent that it was able to help me in conveying my point.<br /><br />I modeled what I was doing after what I saw others doing. Most popular blogs are that way; people go to them seeking ideas or advice that will help them in their own life, and they tend to be pretty impersonal. Popular bloggers aren't discussing the trials and tribulations they were having getting their children to school that morning, unless the blog post happens to be about commuting or child-rearing.<br /><br />What works for the very popular doesn't work for the rest of us. There are many, many people blogging on the Internet, exactly in the way that I am doing here and now. Most of these blogs don't get read by anyone. For me, this doesn't bother me, because I never started doing this for fame or money; I just need to write. I need some sort of outlet for my thoughts. It's just a wonderful bonus that I live in a time when technology allows me to write things, share them publicly, and they sit out there in cyberspace for someone else to read.<br /><br />Just the possibility that <i>some </i>of&nbsp;my words might accidentally reach another human being while they're Googling around for something else is enough for me. I've tried to imagine writing the way I do now on a typewriter, 50 years ago, composing my thoughts on paper and filing them away in the bottom drawer of my desk. Somehow, the prospect of doing this seems far less satisfying. It seems like it would be a very <i>lonely</i>&nbsp;prospect.&nbsp;After the stack of paper had gotten big enough, once I had a critical mass of unshared thoughts, I would probably fish it out of the drawer and try to massage all of it into a publishable form. I would struggle to get it distributed to the world as a book. I need to know that someone <i>could</i>&nbsp;read what I write, that someone <i>might</i> connect with my thoughts...even if I never know about it.<br /><br />An impersonal blog that shares the writer's ideas without sharing the writer works for a certain kind of blog. It's when the reputation of the writer is substantial enough that people seek out their ideas, precisely <i>because</i> the reputation of the writer has lent credence or importance to the ideas. People would seek out the blog of Malcolm Gladwell, because he's Malcolm Gladwell. If he were to blog under a pseudonym, the strength of his writing might eventually give this pseudonymous blog some traction. But if you tried to start your own blog and write like Malcolm Gladwell, people aren't browsing the Internet looking for people who write like him.<br /><br />In the last few years, I've found that personal blogs matter the most to me when I can truly connect not only with the writer's ideas, but the writer themselves. A blog might be about ideas, but if the writer hides who they are, if they don't reveal some part of themselves, if they're completely unwilling to be vulnerable or take any risks whatsoever, then it usually isn't interesting.<br /><br />I don't mean that I want the writer to <i>humiliate</i>&nbsp;themselves; I'm not interested in the kind of exhibitionism that draws people to reality TV. But as readers, we're all looking for connection with someone else's humanity.<br /><br />In the digital world, the biggest risk is not that we'll overshare, but that we <i>under</i>share. Everyone complains about people who post pictures of food that they're about to eat on social media. I don't think this is oversharing per se. The problem is that this kind of post isn't crafted with the audience in mind. The sharer has revealed nothing about themselves. I read it and come away with no deeper understanding of who the sharer is. They've taken no risks. They've made no effort to stretch the minds of the recipients of the message. In this case, they haven't even <i>considered</i> the recipients of the message. It's <i>easy</i>.&nbsp;It's a kind of digital fast food. It does fill space, but the content is ultimately hollow. This is undersharing.<br /><br />Looking back, I can see that I've made this mistake in many of the early entries I wrote on this blog. Many of them amount to little more than "here's some idea for a business". What am I trying to communicate with this kind of thing? Creativity begets creativity, so at the time, I hoped that the expression of my own ideas was able to catalyze the reader into generating their own ideas. But I feel like there's an implicit condescension in all of these old entries that I never intended that makes me want to bury my head in my hands. "Look at how creative I am!" Is this of any use to anyone? As someone trying to write, it's like someone opening up my yearbook from junior high.<br /><br />Naturally, it is possible to overshare. There are things about myself that I wouldn't reveal to the Internet. That's not to say that I have deep dark secrets, but some aspects of a person's life are so personal that I would never recommend <i>anyone</i>&nbsp;share them online. It wouldn't benefit anyone else to read about these kinds of things anyway. There is a balance to all of this.<br /><br />I do understand that there's more potential for truly reaching someone out there on the Internet with my writing if I'm generally honest about my own foibles. It profits me nothing to offer the impression that I'm somehow incapable of making mistakes. I make mistakes all the time, and more often than I'd care to admit, I have great difficulty picking myself up and moving forward from them. It can be painful to learn from your mistakes.<br /><br />Immersion in Internet culture can often make it seem like you're connected with people, but in the age of undersharing, you can ultimately come to feel that you're actually far more isolated than connected. Digital communication in social media has become so impersonal, where people seem preoccupied with crafting an image of themselves and their life. You can begin to believe that no one else faces the difficulties that you face. You can internalize the flawed notion that you're the only person on the planet with an imperfect life. All this connection can actually instill a sense of loneliness. In this, there is very real potential harm that can befall an individual.<br /><br />In light of this, we all have the opportunity to do the opposite and to be honest about who we are. Not to seek sympathy, but to let other the people who would receive our messages know that we all have more in common with one another than we often feel. I'm not claiming this is easy; it takes real guts to expose the real you to the world, in any context. There's always the risk that someone will accuse you of oversharing. But to all of us as human beings, this isn't where the real danger lies.
