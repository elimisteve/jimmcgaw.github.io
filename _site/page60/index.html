                      Imagine that you're living in the past, 120 years ago and you invent this thing called "Jell-O". It's something that a few people are aware of, but it doesn't have mainstream appeal. You figure out a way of mass producing it, and then set about trying to get it into grocery stores around the United States. You start locally, by going to the grocers in your city.Imagine how that conversation would go. You explain to...

                      This past weekend, my girlfriend brought this to my attention: if you volunteer your time helping a non-profit or charity for 100 hours or more over the course of a 12-month period, you receive an award from the President of the United States, called the President’s Volunteer Service Award.

                      Recently, Facebook updated its layout yet again, which was followed by the inevitable wave of status updates complaining about how much the changes sucked. I'm a web programmer for a company that has a consumer-facing web application, and a large part of my job is creating parts of the user interface.

                      On every credit card statement I get every month, there's a little message reading: "A paper trail is an identity thief's best friend. Sign up now to pay your bill online at..." The implication being that if I pay my bill via the Internet instead of snail mail, it's less likely to be stolen by someone mischievous.About five or six times a year, I also get an envelope from my credit card containing five checks...

                      Before the long drive to move out to California from Michigan, I took my car into a dealership for an inspection. Turned out (big surprise!) that it needed a couple thousand dollars worth of repairs done to the engine, so I told them to fix what was needed and I went to the waiting room.You've been there before: a small, cramped room with a row of chairs, a cheap television, and a carafe of terrible...

                      There's a split in the members of my girlfriend's extended family. It's about the choice of coffee: some of them prefer Starbucks, and some of them prefer Caribou. The debate comes up from time to time. Each side believes, stubbornly, that their choice of coffee is superior to the other. I think it's a silly argument, since we have both, so which one is actually "better" doesn't seem to make much of a difference.Okay, quick...

                      The Internet is a mess. There's value in its content, but in order to get at it, you need to wade through a ton of junk first. Successful web companies help users make order out of chaos. Google did it by making sites with more inbound links rank higher in search results. If you link to a site on your web page, it's as if you're casting a vote for that site to rank higher....
