        Imagine that you're living in the past, 120 years ago and you invent this thing called "Jell-O". It's something that a few people are aware of, but it doesn't have mainstream appeal. You figure out a way of mass producing it, and then set about trying to get it into grocery stores around the United States. You start locally, by going to the grocers in your city.<br /><br />Imagine how that conversation would go. You explain to him: "It's this gelatin stuff, we sell it in powdered form, in packages, and people mix it with hot water to make this squishy, gooey stuff that you can cut into shapes. It's comes in several different colors."<br /><br />To which they might ask: "Why are people supposed to do with it?"<br /><br />"Eat it," you tell them.<br /><br />Try and picture the look on the purveyor's face after you tell them that. Kind of discouraging, isn't it? That is, if you don't know just how successful Jell-O would eventually become. It's easy to laugh at the shopkeeps that said no to stocking the product now, because we know it caught on. Did Orator Francis Woodward know that 100 years later, Jell-O would be a staple in households across the United States? Of course not. All signs told him he should give up because the odds were stacked against him and his product was, for lack of a better term, "weird". But he stuck to it, and eventually found a way to market the product. And now, here we are.<br /><br />That's the problem with new product ideas. Regardless of how inherently "good" they are, chances are between slim and nil that anyone's going to make it easy for you.

        We have the technology that enables us to harness the power of the sun, even on days that aren't sunny, all over the world. If you own a home, you can throw a bunch of solar panels onto your roof, absorbing and storing kilowatt hours in your basement that saves you money on your utility bills. People are doing it now, but it's not nearly as ubiquitous as you might expect, considering how beneficial it is. Why aren't more people doing it? <br /><br />There are lots of reasons. Economists will tell you people don't do this because the financial incentives aren't in place, which is just a fancy way of saying it costs too much. Political scientists will tell you it's because the laws aren't in place, and they'll blame the powerful oil lobby. Environmentalists will tell it's because we're selfish little creatures who don't care about the planet.<br /><br />There's truth in all those reasons, but there's another, far more important one. Consider, if you will, this image of a bunch of solar panels on the roof of someone's house:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 163px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S3wsr1U9aWI/AAAAAAAAAKA/qtq9b0P4pEY/s320/800px-Solar_panels_on_a_roof.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439271581517703522" /><br /><br />Here's a question for homeowners: do you know why you have a lawn? The short answer is: vanity. The reason you have to drag around a mower once a week during the summer is more for grooming and appearance than for any practical reason. That's not a bad thing, but it's a lifestyle choice we've embraced as a culture in this country.<br /><br />The problem with solar panels is not just one of environmentalism or economics, but also one of <em>design</em>. The engineers have created a solution to the solar dilemma from a technological standpoint, and they believe that's enough. Environmentalists believe that people should line the roofs of their houses with these  things because it's the correct thing to do in the "green" sense. But until someone recognizes that the way our houses look is a source of esteem for a lot of people, solar companies are going to have trouble branding these panels for the mainstream.<br /><br />The solar company that wins big is going to be the one that recognizes they are in the fashion business. They'll bring in designers to work with the engineers to hold a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charrette">charrette</a>, find a solution where the technology and design converge, and they'll make something that looks good enough that almost everyone will want them on their roofs.<br /><br />I'd wear a shirt with solar panels on it to let it charge my iPod while I'm out walking in the sunshine. I think a lot of people would, but it will be hard to convince them to wear anything that doesn't look good.

        Imagine that you've just been diagnosed with a terminal disease and you're given six months to a year to live. What would you do? The question itself is kind of a cliche, people don't want to think about it, and most of us that aren't facing the gravity of the situation for real probably can't say for certain.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thelastlecture.com/">Randy Pausch</a> was a professor who, facing that situation, left behind a lecture and a book full of his own inspiration and wisdom. And he has (and will continue to) inspire millions of people posthumously.<br /><br />Mr. Pausch was a professor and in a position of influence, so he got a book deal. What about the rest of us? <br /><br />Here's a pretty nutty idea: with Blogger, you can write a bunch of blog posts all at once and then stagger their releases by setting future release dates. And you can feed these into social media, like Facebook and Twitter. Why not write 120 blog posts sharing your wisdom or stories that have inspired you during your life, create a Facebook page for yourself, and then release one of them per month for the next ten years after you're gone?<br /><br />It's more than a little unsettling to consider the prospect of one of your friends, stricken with cancer, actually doing this. Death isn't supposed to have a presence on Facebook. I could even imagine someone using this idea to time-release a series of suicide notes before they offed themselves.<br /><br />But doing this is a means of persevering in spite of a death, however untimely and unfortunate that death might be. Again, I don't know what someone facing a terminal disease is thinking or feeling, and I wouldn't try to guess. But I think it has the potential to offer those people some hope.<br /><br />The fact that technology, social networks, and RSS feeds give people the capacity to reach out and touch people, even after they're gone, has implications that I think will start to manifest themselves more as the generations using them start getting older.

        I think this project is really interesting:<br /><br /><a href="http://web.mac.com/joelallenschroeder/DMW/dearmrwatterson.html">Dear Mr. Watterson</a><br /><br />An independent filmmaker wanted to make a film about the impact that the comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes" had on his own life, as well as on the lives of so many others. He set out to make a documentary film about the strip, by compiling people's stories about how the strip affected them. The documentary is meant to serve as dedication and thanks to the strip's author, Bill Watterson.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that the film is being funded by people "pledging" whatever money they can afford to contribute to the film's budget. If you pledge $35, for example, you'll get a DVD copy of the film. Pledge $125, they'll include you in the film, either through a photograph or something else you produced. If you pledge $1000, you get credit as an <em>associate producer</em> of the film. (There are five of those slots, and they're sold out.)<br /><br />This is a whole new way of getting funding for a low-budget film: create interest in the film through the Internet and social media, and offer <em>anyone</em> the chance to make financial contributions to the film, perhaps in exchange for some non-monetary compensation. The web offers independent filmmakers the change to leverage the Internet's "architecture of participation". Suddenly, we can all be producers of a low-budget film we want to see.<br /><br />More importantly, notice that it forces filmmakers to find a movie for an audience, instead of trying to find an audience for a movie. It's very expensive to do the latter. Think of how much the creators of <em>Dear Mr. Watterson</em> are going to save by not having to spend big on advertising to get the word out about the film.<br /><br />They hoped to raise $12,000 by March 15th, 2010. At the time I'm writing this, it's still a month away from the deadline and they've gotten almost $17,000.

        This past weekend, my girlfriend brought this to my attention: if you volunteer your time helping a non-profit or charity for 100 hours or more over the course of a 12-month period, you receive an award from the President of the United States, called the <a href="http://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/tg/pvsainfo/dspAboutAwards.cfm">President’s Volunteer Service Award</a>. You get a pin, a certificate, and a letter of recognition from Barack Obama.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/tg/pvsainfo/dspAboutAwards.cfm">You can read the details about it here</a>.<br /><br />I know that times are tough right now, and a lot of people are being forced to work fewer hours due to budget cuts. Many more are unfortunate enough to not be working at all. Like everyone else, I'm holding out hope that things will get better and that job opportunities will appear for who aren't working.<br /><br />After the dust of this economic storm has settled, I wouldn't be surprised if interviewers at those jobs asked candidates how they used all that extra time while they were unemployed. Imagine being in that position, interviewing two prospective hires for a job. The first one claims they spent lots of time watching DVD movies they got in the mail and perfecting the fine art of <a href="http://www.netflixorigami.com/">Netflix Origami</a>. The other one says that they received a <em>President’s Volunteer Service Award</em> for spending time volunteering to help their community.<br /><br />As the interviewer, which candidate would interest you more?<br /><br />I realize that people who actively volunteer are probably not terribly interested in getting any kind of recognition or credit for the work they're doing. But there are those who don't see why they should spend their free time volunteering. Here's your incentive: it'll help you pad your resume, and there's not only a chance you'll enjoy it, but you just might help a lot of people.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/tg/pvsainfo/dspAboutAwards.cfm">Check it out</a>. After you create an account, you can start easily logging your hours on the site and work up towards the 100-hour mark. I would encourage anyone with free time on their hands to start looking for non-profits or local charities you can spend some time helping. And if you're already volunteering your time anyway, it couldn't hurt to keep track of the hours, if only to satiate your own curiosity.<br /><br />(In case anyone's curious, I've got 25 hours logged this year so far.)

        Recently, Facebook updated its layout yet again, which was followed by the inevitable wave of status updates complaining about how much the changes sucked. I'm a web programmer for a company that has a consumer-facing web application, and a large part of my job is creating parts of the user interface. I don't think that makes my opinion any more authoritative than the next person's, but I would like to share what I believe Facebook is doing wrong in its approach to changing their layout.<br /><br />The massive rollout strategy just doesn't work. People don't like it when their favorite web application changes. Facebook announces that they're going to make huge changes, claim that they will be "better", and then everyone is just supposed to get used to them once they're in place. It matters very little whether or not the changes are actually "better" or not, and it does little help to argue that point either way. You're just forcing something on people that they didn't ask for.<br /><br />The whole "let's change everything!" strategy makes me picture a bunch of nerds at Facebook sitting around trying to make work for themselves. In the absence of anything better to do, they decide to reinvent the way the whole thing looks. "Here comes Zuckerberg! Quick, look busy!"<br /><br />Does this remind anyone of Microsoft Office, which changed drastically in layout and appearance in its 2007 version, but didn't seem to add anything of value to its functionality? They just moved the crap in the menu around, kind of the same way you'd move the food around on your plate to try and trick your mom into thinking you ate some it. <br /><br />So what's the alternative to the "culture of looking busy", as seems to be the case at so many tech companies releasing (forcing) product updates onto their consumers? That would be the "culture of testing". The archetype example of a company that understands how to update their interface is Amazon.<br /><br />The way Amazon looks today is much, much different than it was when it launched back in the early 90's. But most of those changes happened gradually, and weren't rolled out to everyone all at once. Amazon rarely releases a huge update to their interface and then forces it on everyone. Instead, they make small, incremental changes and test them to see how people respond.<br /><br />This is called split testing, and if you have a web site, you can use something called the <a href="http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer">Google Website Optimizer</a> (which is free to use) so that you can show half your users one thing and the other half something else. It might something small, like changing the background color of a "Buy It Now!" button between orange and blue, to see if one color makes people more likely to click on the button. You let the test run for a little while until you've gotten enough data to figure out which color is better, and then you set the button to the color that got the most clicks.<br /><br />It makes the process much more democratic. In this way, Amazon can see how people respond to a change or addition to their site. If people don't like a change on a page or a new feature, the Amazon doesn't release it. Or they find a new way to make it work in a way that pleases customers.<br /><br />Seems to me Facebook could do something like that, instead of shocking their users once a year with a bunch of changes all at once.

        On every credit card statement I get every month, there's a little message reading: "A paper trail is an identity thief's best friend. Sign up now to pay your bill online at..." The implication being that if I pay my bill via the Internet instead of snail mail, it's less likely to be stolen by someone mischievous.<br /><br />About five or six times a year, I also get an envelope from my credit card containing five checks inside. By writing in an amount, payee, and signing them, I can automatically borrow against my card's credit limit.<br /><br />Let me see if I have this write, Mr. Credit Card Company: sending a payment in to you each month is risky because it might be intercepted by an identity thief...gotcha. But isn't it possible, then, that these checks you're sending me every few months might also be intercepted and let someone borrow money from you, in my name, pretty easily?<br /><br />I realize that these two inconsistencies are probably the spawn of two completely separate marketing departments at my credit card company's headquarters. It's a large enough company that these two departments might have never even gotten together. <br /><br />Here's the deal: the message you're sending me is the marketing, and marketing is the message. If you're sending mixed messages, that's going to raise some eyebrows. Be consistent in what you're telling us, or else we, as customers, are not going to trust you.

        Before the long drive to move out to California from Michigan, I took my car into a dealership for an inspection. Turned out (big surprise!) that it needed a couple thousand dollars worth of repairs done to the engine, so I told them to fix what was needed and I went to the waiting room.<br /><br />You've been there before: a small, cramped room with a row of chairs, a cheap television, and a carafe of terrible burnt coffee sitting in one corner, next to Styrofoam cups, fake sugar packets, and stirrers. It's the coffee setup they probably have in Hell.<br /><br />The room was empty, so in the interest of focusing on my own thoughts, I went over and turned off the television that was covering national news. About five minutes later, someone else entered the room, walked over, and turned the TV back on. The person never asked me if I minded.<br /><br />This has happened to me before. What's interesting is that if I were to enter a waiting room with a TV on, and people were sitting in the room, it would be impolite of me to turn the TV off without asking everyone. But I've never met anyone who thinks that the opposite situation, where someone comes into a room and turns on the TV, is impolite.<br /><br />We don't even have a protocol for these situations, which is a good indicator of what we consider to be polite. What am I supposed to tell the person who turns the TV on? "Excuse me, but I wasn't watching that." (?)<br /><br />P.S. If you work at a car dealership, you could almost certainly put better coffee in the waiting room. As a matter of fact, there's lot of things you could do to help people pass the time besides a stack of magazines, burnt coffee, and a TV blaring CNN. If everyone other car dealership jumped off a cliff (and in the US, a lot of them are, gradually, every day), would you do it too?

      <div class="content">
        There's a split in the members of my girlfriend's extended family. It's about the choice of coffee: some of them prefer Starbucks, and some of them prefer Caribou. The debate comes up from time to time. Each side believes, stubbornly, that their choice of coffee is superior to the other. I think it's a silly argument, since we have both, so which one is actually "better" doesn't seem to make much of a difference.<br /><br />Okay, quick thought experiment: imagine I show up at the family Christmas, in that house packed full of 20-30 people, with two new bags of coffee, one from Starbucks and Caribou. Let's say I grind the beans, brew one pot of each, and then have everyone taste the Starbucks one, then the Caribou one, and tell me which one they liked better. What do you think is going to happen? Which one do you think each person will prefer?<br /><br />Now imagine that I do the same thing, but I switch them. When I tell them they're drinking Caribou, it's the Starbucks blend, and vice versa. Now what do you think is going to happen? Which one do you think people are going to like? Their favorite kind or the one tastes better?<br /><br />Good brands create cognitive biases in our brains. It doesn't matter that people's choices aren't scientific, or would hold up in any kind of double-blind taste test. It tastes good not necessarily because of what's in the cup, but because we're busy esteeming ourselves for what's on the outside of the cup.<br /><br />In slightly unrelated news, here's an old, hilarious SNL skit with Chris Farley in which he's served Instant Coffee instead of regular coffee in one of those old "hidden camera" gags (I hope it's still up when you read this):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dula.tv/watch.php?file=chris-farley-coffee-switch.flv">Chris Farley Coffee Switch</a>

        The Internet is a mess. There's value in its content, but in order to get at it, you need to wade through a ton of junk first. <br /><br />Successful web companies help users make order out of chaos. Google did it by making sites with more inbound links rank higher in search results. If you link to a site on your web page, it's as if you're casting a vote for that site to rank higher. (It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the idea.)<br /><br />Same with social bookmarking sites like Delicious and Digg. People bookmark their favorite sites, tag them with words, and then others can find them when they search for those words.<br /><br />Technorati is a site that indexes and organizes the content of blogs on the Internet. It helps people searching for content in blogs find the more popular posts.<br /><br />Want to start a successful web company? Help Internet users make order out of chaos. Organize. Create a way for valuable content to bubble to the surface so users can easily find it. How would you do that?<br /><br />Furthermore, most of the existing examples are based on a system of votes or popularity. Could you create a system that wasn't based on that means of ordering?
