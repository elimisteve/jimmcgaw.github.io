        These are probably fighting words, but I do believe that Napster hurt CD sales back when it was widely used by people for downloading music illegally. This happened when I was in college, and as I remember, the bulk of the conversation I heard about it was people talking about how greedy the guys in Metallica were for publicly championing against Napster. Lars Ulrich spent a lot of time in the limelight claiming that their music being freely passed around on the Internet was hurting them as artists, since its distribution was both beyond their control and being done in a manner that didn't give them royalties.<br/><br/>The real problem, I think, is quite different: music industries ignored what people were saying. There are certain conveniences that went along with being able to illegally download music, like not having to walk to a music store, or being able to get only one or two songs off an album instead of committing money to the entire album. Ten years ago, music companies should have been creating places on the Internet where people could do this legally. You can now go on Amazon.com and buy almost any album as an MP3 download for slightly cheaper than having the actual album shipped to you; this is evidence that they're finally listening to customers. The fact that they didn't do this is the reason they've been losing money for the last decade. <br/><br/>I still think there's room for improvement. Ordering a CD might cost $13.99, while the MP3 download for that same album might be around $8.99 or $9.99. Why so much for MP3s? This implies that the packaging, which you don't get with a download, costs them four or five bucks. It doesn't, and we all know that. The reason that CDs were always 12 or 13 bucks was because of the carrying cost associated with it. Retailers have to pay to keep their inventory on hand, either in a warehouse or shelf space.<br/><br/>But we live in the era of the long tail. The carrying cost for Amazon.com to store music is virtually nothing; it's hard disk space and power consumption to keep the servers running, which, if spread out over all the music on a single server, is miniscule. The reason MP3 album downloads are so much is because the music industry is being greedy. They're fighting the extinction of the CD.<br/><br/>Imagine entire albums being purchasable for $2.99 or $3.99 as MP3 downloads. For that cheap, you could buy a new CD almost every day and not spend more than $100 in a month. I think I spend more on <em>coffee</em> in a month. At that price, you wouldn't have time to even listen to all of it, but I bet we'd still be buying tons of them just as a means of sampling new music that's out there. The more people buy stuff, the more they find that they like and the more they'll recommend to their friends. With sales on the Internet, it's all about achieving volume, isn't it? Lower the prices.

        People tend to be really surprised when an actor or actress they really like winds up in a film that is terrible. More often, the actor in question takes a starring role in a movie that ends up being "just okay". Exactly who you think is a good performer, and which of the films they've been in is bad, is your own opinion. I'm not going to provide specific examples, since that's too subjective, but we can all think of a time when we've seen an actor we like in a movie that was difficult to sit through.<br/><br/>I'm not in the film industry; I'm a complete outsider who only ever worked on video productions for his high school TV Productions class, back when cameras recorded directly onto VHS tapes. But, when a critically acclaimed actor ends up in a film that's not well received by audiences or critics, it hardly comes as a surprise to me. The reason, I'm sure, lies in the difference between reading a movie's screenplay and actually putting what's on paper into practice. Movie stars, when they're choosing their roles, have very little to go on besides the script. They read the story, which lacks many of the elements that make a movie entertaining. It lacks depth, visuals, and the exact sense of flow. Knowing what the final result will be is not a function of the actor (usually), but instead of the efforts of the director and the many crew members involved in executing the production of the film.<br/><br/>Being a film director must be difficult. You have a vision, and you have to convey this vision to all of the other people working with you on the film. You need to find a way to point all of these different people in the same direction. You need to get the producers thinking that your idea will work. You need to have faith that the people in marketing will do your film justice when the time comes to create commercials, to communicate to the audience what the film is about. And you have to hope that critics, and the audience themselves, actually like it.<br/><br/>Talk about a labor of love.<br/><br/>The film industry interests me from this perspective. If the competition weren't so numerous and stiff for landing roles, I would love to be an actor in a television or film, just to witness how the whole process goes down. (It would also help if I could act, which I cannot.) Heck, screw the limelight...I'd be content being a gaffer or a production accountant, just to watch a halfway decent film director work his magic.<br/><br/>I think the challenges facing those who make movies are common to anyone working on a project that involves more than two or three people. According to <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, in the software business, as you add more people to a project in the middle of putting together a large piece of software, you actually make things more complicated and things take longer. The more people you have, the more people you have to get communicating with each other; therein lies the challenge. <br/><br/>When you're working on a movie with a multi-million dollar budget with hundreds of people involved, things are going to get ugly at times. Mistakes will be made, tempers will flare. You might remember that costly accident at the beginning of <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, when the confusion on a large movie set in the film caused a series of expensive explosives to be detonated when the cameras weren't rolling. People spent a lot of time flapping their gums in criticism of Christian Bale for losing his cool with a crew member on the set of filming the latest Terminator flick. These kinds of things don't come as a surprise to me; in my opinion, they're to be expected in any work environment with large groups of people working together. When you consider all of the factors involved, it's amazing that films ever end up getting made and released in the first place.<br/><br/>And when movies are done well, it seems easy.

        My dad does a lot of Sudoku puzzles, and I think that most weekends he takes the morning newspaper and does the crossword puzzle. He does this, he says, in the interest of keeping his brain sharp.<br/><br/>While doing Sudokus over and over again are certainly a better means of keeping your brain active than no stimulation at all, the brain would be helped a great deal more by doing something different. After ten Sudoku puzzles, the net benefit to your brain activity starts to wane due to diminishing marginal utility.<br/><br/>The best way to help your brain is to do something different, something that forces your brain to operate on a level that it's not accustomed to. Yesterday, I tried reading a book aloud to my girlfriend and discovered that I had some difficulty in both reading the words aloud and actually comprehending what I was reading at the same time. I'm pretty good at multi-tasking, but this activity was difficult for me. It's precisely this kind of thing that I should spend some time doing more of, to try and get my brain used to doing both of these activities.<br/><br/>If you have a job that makes you do spatial reasoning or analyze large amounts of data looking for trends, learning a musical instrument. If you're a musician, take a class in logic. It occurred to me as I was walking to work this morning that a really good way of using your brain in a new way would be to learn sign language; just the mere act of transferring thoughts from the mind to your hands would be a completely new challenge for people. (At least, it would be for those who don't already know it)<br/><br/>As human beings, we like to emphasize our strengths and downplay our weaknesses, particularly in social settings. I think it's this behavior, more than anything else, is an enabler that allows our brains to atrophy. Doing something different is the best means of countering this. It requires humility on our parts, but I think it's worth it.

        Recently, the college that I attended some five years ago updated their email system, giving their web interface  appearance a facelift and adding functionality that makes it easier to use. This is great, but the old interface that was in place back when I first started going to the college in 2000 was pretty archaic even for standards back in those days. <br/><br/>Now, in 2009, they've done an update and the new system feels very 2004. It's old and clunky, and at times confusing. For example, if you're reading one of your email messages and click the "Delete this message" button, the interface whirs and clicks, and when it's done processing, it dumps you inside of the next email message inside of your inbox, instead of just taking you back to your inbox. This is disorienting and annoying, but forgivable.<br/><br/>One major problem I have with the new system: the total amount is disk space that they've given us to store our emails is 128 MB. It's right at the top of the screen, letting you know that you're using x.x MB of 128 MB of space, and presumably, once you've used it all up, they'll start rejecting your emails when people try to send them to you. This constraint is crap. 128 MB is not a lot of space these days, particularly if you're passing around photos or sending around other files as attachments between classmates.<br/><br/>I just did a Google Shopping search for hard drives, and the first one that came up was a Toshiba 500 GB hard drive for $88. Assuming that 1 GB is 1000 MB (which is technically inexact, but bear with me), you do the math and find that 128 MB of storage space costs about 2 cents.<br/><br/>2 cents of disk space is what they are giving to each student? Seriously? Additionally, my estimate is probably way too high. If you buy in bulk, with the kind of purchasing power that I'm sure Michigan State University has, you can probably get 500 GB of memory for a hell of a lot cheaper than $88 dollars. I'd be surprised if it were costing them anything more than 1/5th of a cent in hard disk space (I'm guessing here). <br/><br/>Allocating 128 MB of space per student email box would be okay at this point in time if they had upgraded the system to use Solid-State drives, but based on how slow the whole thing is running, that's probably not the case.<br/><br/>Of course, I am ignoring the other carrying costs of storing emails for students, like the cost of powering the servers that store all that email, which is an ongoing expense for them. And the more emails that they store, the more bandwidth is going to be consumed by students who are accessing their email archives. But I don't think it can possibly be that much. Not when you consider how much each of us paid (or our parents paid) to let us attend school there for a few years. <br/><br/>This doesn't affect me much because I don't even use MSU's crappy email system anyway. However, I do send a lot of text messages, and about once every two to three weeks, I get a friendly message from Verizon saying that I'm using about 80% of my allotted text message storage, with a warning to delete old messages or else they'll start bouncing my incoming messages. Usually this happens around the time I have 40 or so messages in my inbox and my sent folders.<br/><br/>@Verizon: Really? Are you serious?<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the disk space is on my phone's hardware or if the text messages themselves are stored on a remote Verizon computer server somewhere. That's an interesting question, but it's 2009. I bought my current phone about a year ago. They're shouldn't be <em>any</em> constraint on my text message storage space, and if there is, it should be high enough that I don't notice it for several years.<br/><br/>Perhaps this wouldn't bother me so much if I really thought that Verizon was deleting my old text messages from their system when I delete all of them on my phone. If I had to speculate, I'd say that they aren't. They're probably keeping them around in perpetuity, if for no other reason than they can use them to cover their ass later if a lawsuit ever arises. If they're going to keep that information around for themselves, it should be available to me. I should have the option of accessing it when I want.<br/><br/>When you delete something from a Gmail account, it doesn't disappear from existence completely, but at least each person is given enough storage space that it's unlikely they'll have to make anyone "delete" emails, thereby making them inaccessible to the person who's email box it is.<br/><br/>Privacy and control issues aside, it's odd that Verizon would risk annoying its customers with such a high frequency just to save on some disk space. It's cheap, really cheap. My alma mater might get a pass from me because they're legally a "non-profit", but for a company like Verizon, there's no reason for them to do it.

        Recently, I got a cross-cut paper shredder at Target, which was desperately needed on my part as I had a large box of junk mail sitting in my living room, waiting to be shredded so I could throw it out without worrying that someone was going to try and use the contents to get a credit card in my name. As I spent the two hours opening all of this junk mail and reading it contents, there was one thing that irked me.<br/><br/>On each of my credit card statements, there is a notice that reads "A paper trail is an identity thief's best friend. Sign up to pay your bill online." What they are saying is simple: sending in a check by mail each month in order to pay off the balance on your credit card is unsafe, because the check or the statement might be intercepted in transit, and a bad guy could use the information they gleaned from this "paper trail" to steal my identity and ruin my day. I wonder what these mail-stealing identity thieves look like...are they like leprechauns, gleefully stealing financial data from mailboxes to get their hands on more whiskey or Blarney stones or whatever it is they buy? <br/><br/>In order to avoid this potential security hole, so they claim, I should sign up to pay my credit card bill using their web interface, which allows me to transfer money from my bank account to the credit card company, without the use of a check or "snail mail". Discouraging me from using a check and the post office, the traditional way, is implying that the web interface is more secure. But is it? I have my doubts. Once I have decided to go that route, then I'll have to use that web interface each month in order to pay off my credit card bill. If I'm not going to get a paper statement, then they're probably going to alert me by email, and that means greater risk of succumbing to a possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> scheme. Someone sends me an email that looks like it came from my credit card company, they link to a website that looks like my credit card company's web site, and I unknowingly enter my bank credentials, which are sent to the nefarious bunch of hackers that set up the fraudulent web site to being with. With my bank login and password in hand, they are able to transfer the money in my bank about where they want.<br/><br/>That's just one example. There are tons of other potential security holes in using online banking interfaces in order to transfer money.<br/><br/>I know what they're really doing: the credit card company would like me to opt for the online option so they can cut back on the expense they incur processing checks that are mailed in. When we mail in credit card payments, someone has to open all those envelopes and process all those checks. The credit card companies want to eliminate these people by getting me to do it for them, by using the "convenience" of a web interface.<br/><br/>(Also among my junk mail was at least seven envelopes containing four checks from my credit card company with my name and address on them. By simply writing a payee and amount on them, I could easily borrow money from them on my credit card account using one of these checks. Mmmm-hmmm...what's that you were saying about the dangers of a "paper trail"?)<br/><br/>Ignoring this issue for a moment, I think that saying, "A paper trail is an identity thief's best friend" is flat-out wrong. It's inaccurate, or at best misleading. Sure, it's <em>possible</em> that your information might be compromised if you send it through the post office. Nothing will ever eliminate that risk completely. But I think that it's far more likely that using a web interface, and potentially having to storing my credentials on my credit card company's web site, or initiate bank transfers over Internet connections that may or may not be secure, is a bigger risk.<br/><br/>Partly, it's an issue of control: if my sensitive information is stored in a database on some server somewhere, that information is out of my control. It's a digital abstraction that I cannot physically access or delete in the future, should I ever want to do so.<br/><br/>The other issue is with the size of the dangling carrot and the rabbit chasing it in either scenario. You might have all of your past credit card statements stored in a box in your house somewhere, and it's perfectly possible that burglar might break in, steal that box, and use it for evil purposes. However, burglars are generally not looking for your financial information; they want jewelry, cash, or other small valuables. Even if this burglar did take your box of credit card statements, he's probably not technically savvy enough to know what to do with them. (Although, admittedly, he might know who to <em>sell</em> the information to.)<br/><br/>In any case, if you don't have a house in Bellaire, a burglar is probably not going to go after your financial information. If you've got a 900-square foot house in Cleveland, don't flatter yourself.<br/><br/>On the other hand, financial information for hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of customers, stored in one database on a credit card company's web server is a much bigger carrot. It in turn attracts the very worst of rabbits, who are intelligent enough to devise ways of compromising that information. They have a big incentive to do so, since the information is worth a lot. One person's financial information might not be worth breaking into their house for, but the information of millions of people is certainly worth trying to crack into a computer server for.<br/><br/>This is not to say that we should completely resist doing any financial transactions or manage financial information on the Internet. I don't want to make that claim. The biggest problem I see with people opting to pay their credit card bill online is that if enough people go that route, then eventually they might just eliminate the paper option altogether. As long as there are people like my dad around, who are stuck in their ways and unwilling to give up paying their bills by mail (not that this is a bad thing), the option probably won't go away for a while. I'm not sure how likely this is or how near in the future it might even become a real consideration for companies, but on the whole it's a bad idea. A paper trail isn't an identity thief's best friend; it's <em>our</em> best friend. That's something important to consider before getting rid of it in the name of "convenience".<br/><br/>Take another look at the statement "A paper trail is an identity thief's best friend." What I despise about it most of all is where it places responsibility in the event of identity theft. Let's imagine that I decide, as a customer, to keep paying my bill using the "paper trail" option. A few months later, my identity gets stolen. Because of the wording of this statement, it's implied that it's <em>my fault</em>, because I didn't follow the prudent advice given to me by my credit card company. They can say, "We told you so." It doesn't really matter in what way my identity was stolen, whether because of the paper trail or some other route; most people will just blame themselves. The wording of the statement is psychologically manipulative, in a very subtle way. It will make any victims regret the decision on their part not to opt for paperless billing, they'll feel bad about it, because ultimately, it makes them feel like they <em>should</em> blame themselves.<br/><br/>Hogwash.<br/><br/>Back in 2003, the state of California passed in a piece of very progressive and forward-thinking legislation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_1386">SB 1386</a>. Basically, this requires that any company storing personal information about an individual must notify that individual if that information is ever breached. It's not perfect, because it's open for debate about what constitutes "personal information". The law also only applies to unencrypted data, which is incomplete, since a company can still encrypt sensitive data using poor protocols that can be easily cracked even if they've been stolen by a hacker. However, the bill itself is a good thing, since it puts the burden on companies to keep thing secure.<br/><br/>Let me repeat that, because you might have dosed off at some point in the last few paragraphs: requiring companies to disclose breaches of personal data to individuals gives them an incentive to keep things secure. The real problem with SB 1386 is that it <em>only applies to California citizens</em>. For everyone else, as it stands right now, if your sensitive information is ever stolen because some hacker stole it off a company's web server, they're not required to tell you about it. You won't know until you go to apply for a bank loan a year later and find that there were a bunch of new credit cards issued in your name by some person that appropriated your credit information. This is a bad thing, but financial companies don't want this to change because they don't want the bad PR, dissatisfied customers, or worst of all, the potential for liability. If your bank tells you your information was compromised and you get your identity stolen, your first inclination would probably be to sue the pants off of your bank. They don't want this, and it's the reason they vehemently opposed SB 1386.<br/><br/>I've only ever known a couple of people who actually had their identity stolen, but the details are infuriating. I asked one of my friends about it, and they told me that the person has used their social security number to get a small loan from Washington Mutual. What shocked me about this is that on the loan application that the thief filled out, they <em>didn't even use my friend's name</em>; they used either their own (unlikely) or an alias (probably). <br/><br/>Okay, simple question: when "handing out" bank loans, why can't Washington Mutual perform a simple check to make sure the name they've provided matches their social security number? Is this a difficult thing to do?<br/><br/>It isn't difficult, but they don't do it because they don't <em>need</em> to. <em>They</em> don't bear the burden of a thief taking out a bogus loan using someone else's credit. Neither does the company from which my friend's information was stolen in the first place, whoever they might be. Instead, it fell on my friend's shoulders, who had to spend a bunch of their personal time filing a police report, filling out forms, and all the other efforts in an effort to clear their name.<br/><br/>The problem here is with accountability when personal information is stolen. For most financial companies, there is none, California companies being the exception. Washington Mutual wasn't required to verify the person's identity when they applied for the loan. The company from which my friend's information was stolen was required to tell my friend about it when it happened, which could have given my friend enough warning to stop the bogus loan from occuring in the first place. This makes sense, since it's comparatively cheaper to deal with the occasional fraudulent loan or breach than risk losing customers by fully disclosing problems. Companies that collect and store personal information, whatever it is, need to be made accountable when that information is leaked through full disclosure, and companies like Washington Mutual that issue loans need to have mechanisms in place to check the identity of the applicant, which should at least include checking that the person's name matches their provided social security number.<br/><br/>A "paper trail" is not an identity thief's best friend: sloppy practices in the day-to-day operations of financial institutions are. It makes it way too easy for bad guys to commit fraud, and it's the banks like it. It good for their business, or rather, it's not as bad for business as the alternative would be. It's not our fault; it's theirs.<br/><br/>What we need is legislation that regulates this at a federal level. While I hold a small handful of Libertarian-esque opinions, this is one area where the "free market" just won't cut it. A couple of years ago, there was the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1558">Federal Agency Data Breach Protection Act</a>, but that didn't get very far before being shot down. If you've got a spare moment, I'd say this is a good point to draft up in an email and send off to your representatives in the US Congress. Tell them that you want this to be enacted. <br/><br/>A lot of people are probably writing letters to their representatives expressing their opinion about healthcare reform. Why not do as they do and "tack on a rider" to your letter? Mention the issue of requiring full disclosure of leaked personal information at the same time. It might not get us anywhere, since financial companies lobby pretty heavily against this sort of thing, but I plan to write a few letters this weekend.<br/><br/>If nothing else, think long and hard about whether or not you want to start paying your bills online.

        On the wait to board our airplane in Detroit before flying back to California last month, I overhead an announcement in the terminal:<br/><br/>"The threat level according to [some organization] is: Orange."<br/><br/>I turned to the nearest baggage handler standing by me and asked him what "Threat level: Orange" meant. Trying to avoid eye contact with me, he said that he didn't know and that I would have to talk to someone in TSA to find out.<br/><br/>So, question: how in the hell is anyone supposed to know what "Threat level: Orange" means? A color is not quantifiable in the human mind. "Orange" doesn't even afford a person a sense of where it lies in relation to other colors. Does it use the colors of a rainbow as its range? If so, what's at the top, Red or Violet? It's not even safe to assume that a rainbow is being used here. Maybe they correspond to those delightful Teletubbies, and the orange one was the least threatening.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not going to Google it. Fuck that. If the organizational body (in this case, I presume it's the TSA) that decided upon using colors as a means of setting threat levels wanted to help me as a person, they've failed miserably. You can't expect people to look that kind of information up, since most people don't travel a lot. And even if you do look it up, "Orange" is still unintuitive enough to be useless. There's no mnemonic there.<br/><br/>Let's say you've got five levels you need to specify. Here's what you use: "Safe", "Low", "Medium", "High", and "Everyone's Fucked". Very clear, self-explanatory phrases with semantic meaning for the average human brain. <br/><br/>The engineers that created this system, like so many others, ignored human frailty. Because of this, they've failed to create something useful. (although I might be wrong in assuming that "useful" was the end goal here)

        "So, dude, what's your major?"<br/><br/>It was a question that I dreaded being asked during my later years college, particularly when I was out at parties trying to have a good time. Some bright-eyed young freshman would come up to me and ask me what my major was. Every now and then, the question was genuine, but more often than not, the other person was clearly hoping that I would reciprocate and ask them their major. Then, they could go off on a long spiel about how <em>interesting</em> their major is and how much <em>money</em> they were going to make when they graduated.<br/><br/>I was probably guilty of this myself when I was a freshman. If my memory isn't too self-serving, I got over it pretty quickly. I realized that these kinds of people went on to become those people you meet at your high school reunion who talk about nothing but where they live, how expensive it is, and how well their jobs pay. I don't think there's any kind of conversation that's more boring or annoying than this.<br/><br/>For a while, I tried to argue with people on this point. They would tell me they were going to go into sociobiology and they'd make six figures right out of school. Mmmm-hmmm. Really? Are you sure? I think you need to do that research again, or re-do that math. Unless you know someone in that particular field with lots of loose cash, and that person happens to be one of your parents, then that dream is probably a long shot that will never come to fruition. <br/><br/>We can probably blame our college advisors for these delusions.<br/><br/>After a while, I stopped trying to argue with people on these kinds of things. If I met someone who really believed they were going to become super wealthy with a degree in social work, I decided it was better to let them go on thinking it. But c'mon, if you really think that your worth as a person is determined in any way by how well your job pays, then at least consider one that has a reputation for paying well, like corporate law.<br/><br/>Eventually, I realized that when I met people at parties who asked me what my major was, these were people that I was never going to see again. So, I could say my major was anything I wanted it to be. I could play myself off as any kind of person I wanted.<br/><br/>Here was a typical response of mine that, while nerdy, I used more times than I can remember:<br/><br/>Person: "So, dude, what are you majoring in?"<br/>Me: "Engineering."<br/>Person: "Whoa, really? That's awesome. What kind?"<br/>Me: "Social."<br/>Person: "Ah...is that hard?"<br/>Me: "Not as hard as you might think."

        I always wonder when I'll wake up and think, "Man, I'm old." It hasn't happened yet. I wonder when it will dawn on me. Maybe when I hear a Nirvana song on an oldies station.<br/><br/>Sometimes I miss being 21, like most guys, but most of the time I'm glad that I've managed to attain some stability in my life. But I don't feel like I'm past the prime of my life and I'm not sure when that's going to happen.<br/><br/>My dad always says, "You're only as old as you feel." I interpret that to mean something like, "If you use the power of denial, <em>really hard</em>, you can convince yourself that you're <em>not</em> old." <br/><br/>As I've said before, I'm not very sentimental. I have the occasional bout of nostalgia, but I don't dwell on it too much, because life is still happening for me. You never know: the days I'm living through right now could be the "good ol' days" that I talk about several years from now. <br/><br/>Eventually, I'll find myself clinging to something that people much younger than me think is antiquated. Most of the things that have been produced in my lifetime, however, haven't been all that great. Music's been okay, major retail chains put small mom and pop operations out of business before I was old enough to care, and contemporary art is just plain garbage. As a whole, there's not that much substance from a cultural perspective for my generation to cling to. So we've all got that going for us.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too cynical. Or too old.

      <div class="content">
        One area where I think usability should really be addressed, for safety's sake, is in the creation of traffic signs. Have you ever been driving in an area with which you weren't all that familiar, and you're looking for the entrance to a highway? You need to head north, and as you approach the highway, you see the entrance ramp for southbound, and sign pointing you to continue over the overpass to enter the northbound flow on the other side.<br/><br/>Now, the question is: which lane do you need to be in: left or right? If you're on a one-lane road, this doesn't matter, but in my experience, if you're on a two-lane road bustling with lots of traffic, you've got a problem. You're not sure if you need to turn left and go straight to merge onto northbound, or if you turn right to make a huge loop before you merge. Entrance ramps vary in design.<br/><br/>Some places, the signs are helpful enough to keep you informed. "Keep Left" or "Left Lane", the sign will read, so you know which lane to be in and which way you'll need to turn. But if this isn't there, and you cannot see ahead to know which lane you should be in, you might end up in wrong lane and have to cut over at the last second. This is an accident waiting to happen.<br/><br/>If you're already familiar with the area, then you already know and this isn't a problem you're likely to notice. This is why all engineers need perspective. I'm sure the local civil engineers worked very hard to create the signs that are there, marking the entrance ramps to highways, and they gave a lot of thought to how the sign should be placed, height-wise, and so forth, but when they took a test drive, they already <em>knew</em> which lane they needed to be in. They gave no thought to visitors, precisely the people who need the most help in these cases.<br/><br/>And even if most of the locals are able to remember which lane to be in to get on the highway on the other side, they forget. I forget, and I need to be reminded. Give me slack.

        I don't travel a whole lot, but when I do, I'm always astonished by how terrible the stores at the airports are. Airports themselves are dens of tedium; they are magnets for boredom and long wait times. Usually, I've got at least four books that I'm reading, so I am able to keep my nose stuck in a book to pass the time. That, and airports are a great place to people-watch. You can pick a random person sitting in the terminal with you that looks interesting and start weaving a narrative about them in your head.<br/><br/>On some days, though, I'm less inspired and cannot imagine my way into an entertaining wait between flights. Sometimes I just can't focus enough to read the books that I've chosen to cart along. When this happens, I start to walk through the long stretches of concourse to find some other extrinsic source of entertainment. On these walks, the only respite from the stadium seating filled with miserable-looking people waiting for their flights are the shops and restaurants.<br/><br/>The shops are never that interesting. There is always a half a dozen shops with different names which are all basically the same: selling drinks, magazines, travel-sized toiletries, and any various little tourist-y souvenirs you can buy to remind yourself of your layover. They're a plain-vanilla means of buying basic supplies. They are the retail equivalent of popping Valium.<br/><br/>Besides this, some major chains have set up shop and are selling a few cross-sections of their inventory. Borders is one example. They've got the more popular titles in the more popular sections of their stores sitting as a tiny store in the airport. But because the environment is different, it doesn't feel like Borders and it isn't any fun. It's uncomfortable. You feel rushed in there but Borders is supposed to be a place you go to loiter.<br/><br/>Here's an idea: open up a used book store in an airport. To start, carry a lot of more popular titles. Then, to keep the inventory rotating, have a trade-in policy. Most used book stores mark their books at half the cover price, and offer to give you half off of <em>that</em> price if you trade in a book of equal value. For people on the go, they are finishing books and looking to get new ones. Give them the opportunity to give their old book to you and get a new one fairly cheaply. <br/><br/>Because inventory is driven by foot traffic, you'd end up with a lot of current titles. You might end up with the occasional copy of Dianetics that you'd have to throw out, but otherwise, supply and demand manages your stock for you.<br/><br/>Airports are teeming with people who are tired, bored, and ready to be engaged in something. Starbucks does quite well for this reason. Incidentally, on the coffee front, airports seem to be set. In other areas, businesses are sorely lacking. I think there's potential here. Why not open a retail shop that includes the ability to let people buy and load MP3s onto their iPods? Not everyone is travelling with a laptop.<br/><br/>Of course, you have to be willing to go through a security check every time you go to work.
