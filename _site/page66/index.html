                      You've met that person. The person who comes off as arrogant, name-dropping, and condescending. It's clear that they think they're better than you in several ways, and while we all feel this way to some extent, this person has an unabashed knack of implying it in casual conversation. And they do it often.The most annoying thing I've found is that you cannot compete with a person who has the elitist mentality, because they'll always find...

                      These are probably fighting words, but I do believe that Napster hurt CD sales back when it was widely used by people for downloading music illegally. This happened when I was in college, and as I remember, the bulk of the conversation I heard about it was people talking about how greedy the guys in Metallica were for publicly championing against Napster. Lars Ulrich spent a lot of time in the limelight claiming that their...

                      People tend to be really surprised when an actor or actress they really like winds up in a film that is terrible. More often, the actor in question takes a starring role in a movie that ends up being "just okay". Exactly who you think is a good performer, and which of the films they've been in is bad, is your own opinion. I'm not going to provide specific examples, since that's too subjective, but...

                      My dad does a lot of Sudoku puzzles, and I think that most weekends he takes the morning newspaper and does the crossword puzzle. He does this, he says, in the interest of keeping his brain sharp.While doing Sudokus over and over again are certainly a better means of keeping your brain active than no stimulation at all, the brain would be helped a great deal more by doing something different. After ten Sudoku puzzles,...

                      Recently, the college that I attended some five years ago updated their email system, giving their web interface appearance a facelift and adding functionality that makes it easier to use. This is great, but the old interface that was in place back when I first started going to the college in 2000 was pretty archaic even for standards back in those days. Now, in 2009, they've done an update and the new system feels very...

                      Recently, I got a cross-cut paper shredder at Target, which was desperately needed on my part as I had a large box of junk mail sitting in my living room, waiting to be shredded so I could throw it out without worrying that someone was going to try and use the contents to get a credit card in my name. As I spent the two hours opening all of this junk mail and reading it...

                      On the wait to board our airplane in Detroit before flying back to California last month, I overhead an announcement in the terminal:"The threat level according to [some organization] is: Orange."I turned to the nearest baggage handler standing by me and asked him what "Threat level: Orange" meant. Trying to avoid eye contact with me, he said that he didn't know and that I would have to talk to someone in TSA to find out.So,...

                      "So, dude, what's your major?"It was a question that I dreaded being asked during my later years college, particularly when I was out at parties trying to have a good time. Some bright-eyed young freshman would come up to me and ask me what my major was. Every now and then, the question was genuine, but more often than not, the other person was clearly hoping that I would reciprocate and ask them their major....

                      I always wonder when I'll wake up and think, "Man, I'm old." It hasn't happened yet. I wonder when it will dawn on me. Maybe when I hear a Nirvana song on an oldies station.Sometimes I miss being 21, like most guys, but most of the time I'm glad that I've managed to attain some stability in my life. But I don't feel like I'm past the prime of my life and I'm not sure...

                      One area where I think usability should really be addressed, for safety's sake, is in the creation of traffic signs. Have you ever been driving in an area with which you weren't all that familiar, and you're looking for the entrance to a highway? You need to head north, and as you approach the highway, you see the entrance ramp for southbound, and sign pointing you to continue over the overpass to enter the northbound...
