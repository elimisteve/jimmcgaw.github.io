                      My name is Jim, I'm an advocate for women's equality, and I'm angry.There are several advantages to being a man in our world. One of these is that men are allowed to get angry about things. If a woman gets mad about gender stereotypes, inequality, or voices an objection to the manner in which she's being treated, it can easily be dismissed as hormones or her period or some such nonsense.

                      I'd say the one of the biggest corners I've turned in my life is when I stopped evaluating people merely based on how well they treated me, and started giving a much greater weight to how well they treated everyone else.

                      Recently, I've been consuming several feminist writings. Most of the views that I've been consuming on feminism are what I remember learning (but have largely forgotten) from studying gender issues in my early years in college. Having been exposed to these ideas in the past, I find that there are few barriers for me in re-approaching them now. There is a pay gap, the legal system and current legislation don't allow for adequate remedies for...

                      I got out of a long-term relationship that lasted over a decade about seven months ago. It ended messily, and I came away thinking that I wouldn't want to repeat the same mistakes again in any future relationships. After some time mourning, I started investigating how to get back on that particular horse; namely, what exactly should you do to get back into the dating arena?I spent some time browsing information online, almost all of...

                      The religious misanthrope who loves God but claims to hate men in the name of God is a man who stands in opposition to God. His hatred brings him into kinship with that which he claims to hate and divides him from that entity which he claims to love. He chooses to hate that which God loves, since God hates no man, not even the man who chooses to hate other men in His name....

                      This has irked me for quite some time now.I was in a committed relationship for the entirety of my 20's, during which I ignored most of the statistics that came out of studies about romantic relationships. I'm single now, and re-examining a lot of the ideas that I've come across in the last couple decades of my life. Here's one that I've always come across, and despised, but decided to remain silent on: that people...

                      Here's my favorite piece of writing advice that I've ever heard:"Give the audience one and one, let them make two, and they'll love you for it forever."As writers, we're advised to avoid tautologies. This goes one step further. We shouldn't just avoid saying the same thing twice. We should leave out pieces of information, gaps that the reader must fill in with their own understanding.(I should point out that I've never studied writing; I just...

                      A few months ago I wrote about Christianity. That post was intended to be a sardonic tome that straddled the middle ground between believers and unbelievers, pointing out that one can easily find meaning in Christian scripture while at the same time calling into question its authority by deriding the authenticity of several of its claims.I began studying the Christian religion because I wanted to answer one fundamental question: why is it that, 2000 years...

                      Being the complete and total geek that I am, I always carry pens with me in the front pockets of my jeans. Sooner or later, the cap comes off of one of them and the front of my jeans gets stained with blobs of ink.Despite this, I continue to wear the jeans. Sure, I could&nbsp;replace them, but if I'm meeting someone new for the first time, and they're sizing me up, I think having the...
