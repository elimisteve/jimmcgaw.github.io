        No blog post I've written on here is a static representation of my core inner beliefs.&nbsp;When I'm blog a post about myself or my view of the world, each is merely a reflection of whatever thoughts are tumbling through my head at the time. I compose them into language in order to help myself make sense of them, and I publish them onto the Internet because I'd like to believe that there are a few other people in this world who might benefit from joining me through the process.<br /><br />After I write something and publish it for the world, I often find myself returning to what I've written in my mind. Sometimes I think of a better way I could have worded something; sometimes I recognize how something I've said could be misinterpreted; sometimes the idea itself is too simple or I find a counterexample that makes me think I might have been completely wrong.<br /><br />I <a href="/2016/02/24/the-weak.html" target="_blank">wrote a while back</a> that nothing tells you more about a person than how they choose to divide up human beings. Some people do this based on class, religion, race, nationality, and so on. I think it's true that the schisms a person applies to human beings say a lot about who they are, but I don't think it defines them. I'd like to believe that not everyone draws these divisions amongst their fellow human beings. I'd like to believe that some people can operate without judgment. That might be too idealistic.<br /><br />I think that the notion that how a person divides up others is a symptom of a larger characteristic. Which human beings a person divides themselves from, and how they divide themselves from them, is one aspect of that person's personality. It falls under a much larger umbrella.<br /><br />Suffering is universal. As a college-educated middle class white guy in America who's never had any serious health issues, I've managed to avoid all forms of physical pain thus far. Naturally, I've had my own small share of emotional suffering. This is common to all human beings. Even those who might say that psychology is an invention of developed society, all mature human beings know the pain that accompanies the loss of a loved one.<br /><br />What defines a human being, more than anything, is the manner in which they try to avoid feeling or dealing with this emotional pain. Some use alcohol or other substances. Some use religion or spirituality. Some use too much food or a lack of food. Some people fall in love. Some people intellectualize everything. Some people watch too much television. And yes, some people elevate themselves above, or discriminate against, other human beings. The list goes on.<br /><br />Everyone experiences emotional pain. Many people find ways of expressing this emotional pain, but every person will, at some point in their lives, do something to be avoidant. A sense of loneliness or fear strikes you one evening, and you have a glass of wine to take the edge off. I'm not saying that every person needs to always confront their emotions, in every situation, or that not doing so is irresponsible. If you're at work, you might need to put your duty before leaning into your feelings. And there certainly are healthy ways of dealing with these emotions. The line between healthy and dysfunctional is a difficult one to draw; television might help you deal with your emotions, but it also might help you avoid them. The difference is subtle.<br /><br />It's the tool that you turn to habitually in order to avoid dealing with emotional pain that says the most about the kind of person you are.

        My name is Jim, I'm an advocate for women's equality, and I'm angry.<br /><br />There are several advantages to being a man in our world. One of these is that men are allowed to get angry about things. If a woman gets mad about gender stereotypes, inequality, or voices an objection to the manner in which she's being treated, it can easily be dismissed as hormones or her period or some such nonsense. I'm not the owner of a baby oven, so I don't menstruate, so you're not going to shut me up that easily. Also, a man can so easily dismiss a woman's point of view, simply because she is a woman, but such a sexist dismissal doesn't work if the objection comes from another man.<br /><br />It occurs to me that all men have this advantage in their respective corners of the world. Eric Metaxas wrote in the introduction to his book <i>Seven Men</i>, "Men are meant to use their strength to protect and bless those who are weaker." I'm not claiming that women are inherently weaker than men, but where gender-based discrimination exists in our society, women are too often&nbsp;<i>made</i>&nbsp;weaker by the circumstances imposed on them. This is where men have a duty to fight such discrimination.<br /><br />I've barely started going around telling people that I'm interested in fighting for women's equality in our society for a week now. I present my ambition as a nascent idea, one without specific form or direction, but merely as a passionate interest on my part. I've already encountered resistance to the idea. One man did exactly as I would have expected by emasculating me, implying that it made sense since I prefer the company of women as friends given the kind of person I seemed to be. I've always greatly preferred the company of other men, which anyone who knows me would gladly attest to; I have no idea what he was talking about.<br /><br />Gender inequality seems to affect those of lower social or economic standing more than those in privilege. This is not to say the privileged are unaffected, but the effects are more pronounced as you go down the social ladder. One middle class white woman, who would discourage me from pursuing this ambition, reassured me that she felt in no way disenfranchised by the current structure of our society. I slept no better that night.<br /><br />For the most part, I've met with general apathy. I mention that I feel this is an important issue to discuss, and people wish me luck, but I get the sense that people feel this isn't a fight that needs to be fought anymore. More likely, I suspect this issue is easy to dismiss simply because it's <i>so huge</i>. It's incredibly pervasive. It's a social problem. It's an economic problem. It's a political problem. It's a legal problem. And so on. It's gets even more complicated when you consider how enmeshed these domains can get with each other.<br /><br />I'm a technologist, which doesn't seem to fit neatly into any category where this issue could be addressed...but I'm also determined. I believe it's worth exploring what can be done by me with my own set of skills, and learning better how to do it. This has done little to dissuade my interest; indeed, the sheer enormity of the problem keeps me engaged. It's almost impossible to ignore, simply because half of the people that I encounter when I leave the house every day are affected by it.

        I'd say the one of the biggest corners I've turned in my life is when I stopped evaluating people merely based on how well they treated me, and started giving a much greater weight to how well they treated everyone else.

      <div class="content">
        Recently, I've been consuming several feminist writings. Most of the views that I've been consuming on feminism are what I remember learning (but have largely forgotten) from studying gender issues in my early years in college. Having been exposed to these ideas in the past, I find that there are few barriers for me in re-approaching them now. There is a pay gap, the legal system and current legislation don't allow for adequate remedies for women who are victims of violence or discrimination, and everyday sexism on the part of men towards women seems rampant in our culture everywhere.<br /><br />Despite the controversy that seems to surround these issues in our culture, I accept that these ideas are true. They make me extremely uncomfortable, and I wish that they <i>weren't</i>&nbsp;true in our world, but I don't struggle to accept and acknowledge them as facets of our reality. I'm comfortable accepting the discomfort, because comfort breeds apathy, and I'm interested in escaping apathy into exploring further what could be done to further the cause of feminism.<br /><br />I've briefly touched upon the writings of Camille Paglia. I struggle to makes sense of and accept her ideas, because they fly in the face of what I know of feminism. For that reason, I've decided to touch upon them here. I'm less interested in parroting what others have said than I am in exploring the ideas around this issue that I'm struggling to understand, and find a way to reconcile them to what I know, wherever possible.<br /><br />I'm not sure I've consumed enough of what she's written to really do justice to her points, but her overall point seems to boil down to this: feminism is about individual responsibility on the part of each woman in this world.<br /><br />She talks a great deal about this idea in the context of rape. Women should be properly educated about the dangers of the world. Now, rape is a broad term, and she clarifies that some situational awareness is required to understand what she's talking about with her ideas. In the case where a man jumps out of the bushes and assaults a woman at night in a dark alley, that's <i>clearly</i>&nbsp;a situation that the woman could not have done anything about. The man should be caught and prosecuted for the criminal that he is.<br /><br />Her own opinion on the matter is about a different kind of situation. I'll use this one as a simple example: if a woman meets a man at a college party, she's been drinking, and he invites her up to his room, she should be aware of the risk here and recuse herself from the situation. Each woman should take responsibility for her own safety. If you don't want to end up at risk, then don't go out drinking and partying in an environment where you would expect sexual violence to be happening.<br /><br />Paglia takes the rather libertarian viewpoint that we, as a society, simply cannot instill enough rules and laws to completely regulate male sexuality. Her point may be alarming or unsettling, but I think the argument does require consideration. Perhaps feminism <i>can </i>err too much on the side of idealism, believing incorrectly that we can move to a world where all men have learned the difference between right and wrong, to control all their sexual urges to the point where they're appropriate, and sexual assaults against women simply never occur. It's a wonderful ideal, to be sure, but can we actually attain it? It's important to remember that you can only make strides towards any ideal if you temper your thinking with realism. It seems to me that most feminists understand this; perhaps Paglia's argument is geared towards the minority that doesn't.<br /><br />I'm not a woman, so I should not be telling women what or how to think about these kinds of issues. I simply don't have the understanding or perspective required. The very reason I'm reading about these issues is simply that I'm trying to become more empathic to other perspectives that I don't fully understand.<br /><br />I can, however, speak to men.<br /><br />I've spent enough time in the company of men to understand what they are like, and what kinds of attitudes they often have towards women. They are not always as enlightened as I would personally prefer. There are sexist attitudes that flourish, and jokes made at women's expense. Thankfully, in all my experience, I've never heard of or personally encountered a situation in which a man I knew did something non-consensual with a woman. The side effect of this is that my experience has failed to teach me that jokes and attitudes cause any real harm. I wonder now: did they? Did they contribute to something that I simply never witnessed? The data points in my head might merely be labeled incorrectly.<br /><br />So the jokes and attitudes among men don't necessarily lead to immorality, but what I&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>understand is that they exist in a social context where all of the men are seeking status with one another. If one man makes a joke that is sexist or inappropriate, another man that stands up to him, he risks rejection. He risks losing social standing with his peers. Psychological experiments tell us that&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection#Ball_toss_.2F_cyberball_experiments" target="_blank">social rejection is one of the more painful mental experiences</a>&nbsp;an individual might face in everyday life. This kind of rejection activates the same parts of the brain that get activated if you experience physical pain.<br /><br />I'm going to say that again, just in case it slipped by unnoticed: <i>social rejection activates the same unpleasant neural circuitry in our brains that the experience of physical pain does</i>. In the experiments I referenced above, it made no difference that the people rejecting the test subject were total strangers. In a group of men making sexist jokes and comments, can one single man who knows better be forgiven for not speaking up and objecting when he feels that something being said is sexist? Perhaps not, but if this conclusion from psychology is true, perhaps this helps <i>explain</i>&nbsp;it.<br /><br />And in this case, I'm merely talking about an inappropriate comment or joke. What about standing up to inappropriate <i>action</i>? If a man objects to a verbal comment he feels is sexist, risking the rejection from his friends in doing so, in most cases the man who made the joke can simply shrug off the objection. If a man is rebuked for something that he said, he's far less likely to get defensive about it than if he is rebuked for something that he <i>did</i>. If a man rebukes another man for doing something inappropriate with a woman, it's <i>very</i>&nbsp;likely that he'll be dismissed or ridiculed himself. The man who stands up against his peers to stop inappropriate behavior must do so in the face of certain mental anguish, loss of status, and a blow to his own self-esteem.<br /><br />So what incentive do men have to stand up to these kinds of things? It's a difficult question. My only answer, and the reason that I hope I have the courage to stand up to these kinds of things if (or, God help me, <i>when) </i>I encounter them in the future is that I don't want to leave behind a world in which these things are passively tolerated or completely ignored. Social injustice, by its definition, never occurs in isolation. Such injustice can only be fought when an individual voluntarily chooses to take this mental anguish associated with social rejection upon themselves.<br /><br />And besides, as a man, isn't taking some measure of neural mental anguish upon yourself worth it to stop physical anguish against another human being? Isn't that reason enough?<br /><br />Men will continue to make sexist jokes and comments, and alas, this will continue to create social contexts in which sexual assaults against women will occur. It is easy for people in these social contexts to turn a blind eye, to passively go along with what is happening, rather than object and risk rejection from peers. Just as we cannot expect men to do what is right, we cannot expect women to look out for themselves in every situation. An individual woman might understand that she's safer at home on any given evening than at a house party or bar, but if all of her friends are pressuring her into coming with them, then she might very well go along to avoid the same sense of rejection that men avoid by refusing to stand up to injustice.<br /><br />Camille Paglia's point about individual responsibility on the part of women in avoiding sexual assaults is a prudent one. I believe it's only valuable as preventative advice and <i>not</i>&nbsp;as consolation for victims. Telling a victim of sexual assault that they were in any way at fault for what happened doesn't seem like the correct thing to do, <i>ever</i>. But at the risk of sounding diminutive, if you are a woman, I'd say you're stronger than our culture might lead you to believe. <i>Know this</i>, and&nbsp;take care to look out for yourself.<br /><br />And as far as the individual goes, it is the same for men. Onto each of us falls the individual responsibility of standing up to sexism and its associated injustices when we encounter them. At the risk of sounding diminutive, if you are a man, you are capable of acting with more humanity than our culture might lead you to believe. <i>Know this</i>, and take care to do what is right.

        I got out of a long-term relationship that lasted over a decade about seven months ago. It ended messily, and I came away thinking that I wouldn't want to repeat the same mistakes again in any future relationships. After some time mourning, I started investigating how to get back on that particular horse; namely, what exactly should you do to get back into the dating arena?<br /><br />I spent some time browsing information online, almost all of which was abysmal for my purposes. Much of it was advice for men by men about how to charm a woman you've just met to get her between the sheets. These tactics have their place, and I'm certainly no sultan of seduction myself, but for me, this comes only <i>after</i>&nbsp;some kind of connection has been established.<br /><br />I came away from this online browsing knowing nothing more than I did going into it. I gave it some consideration, and I realized that much of what I was looking for is stuff that you're not going to find in any online article about how to date properly. Knowing how to establish a good romantic relationship with another person depends first and foremost on understanding yourself and what you want to get out of a relationship. In the context of the relationship, it's just as important to establish who the other person is and who they are.<br /><br />Any article that gives you tips on "how to treat women" or "how to treat men" is invariably going to contain at least <i>some </i>bad information. Not all men are the same, just as not all women are the same. Two people come together as individuals. In each new possible relationship, you can use your own knowledge as a guide, but essentially, you're starting from scratch <i>every time</i>.<br /><br />So this is how I came to regard myself as a <i>Socratic romantic</i>. If true knowledge consists in knowing that you know nothing, then when I'm meeting a woman for the first time, the wisest thing I can do is understand that most of what I've learned from history is immediately out the window. Going into a new situation, I will simply have <i>no clue whatsoever</i>&nbsp;how to satisfy a woman's emotional or romantic needs. (The regular gift of flowers is probably a good mainstay, but this alone isn't a foundation.)<br /><br />Dialogue between individuals was Socrates' preferred method of arriving at the truth. Truth didn't exist in either person's head, but he felt that in trying to bring their understanding to the space between them through conversation, truth would emerge. And so my theory is that this dialogue needs to happen in any budding romance, as soon as you've gotten past the small talk, and both gotten of sense of who the other person is. I don't know how soon is too soon (sometime after immediately but before the first year anniversary, I'd guess), but I suspect this needs to happen early.<br /><br />As I'm writing this, this is merely a germ of an idea I had, and I haven't had the chance to put it into practice. I thought the idea alone was enough to write about. And, maybe this advice is obvious. Now that I'm typing this out, it sure <i>sounds</i>&nbsp;obvious, but then, I've come across an awful lot of guys who, when you ask them for advice on women, are more than happy to explain to you precisely <i>what women want.</i>&nbsp;As though they are all the same. I've heard women give such advice about men to other women. The gender stereotype originated in a culture in which all people are trying to serve their basest desire: to procreate.

        The religious misanthrope who loves God but claims to hate men in the name of God is a man who stands in opposition to God. His hatred brings him into kinship with that which he claims to hate and divides him from that entity which he claims to love. He chooses to hate that which God loves, since God hates no man, not even the man who chooses to hate other men in His name.

        This has irked me for quite some time now.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I was in a committed relationship for the entirety of my 20's, during which I ignored most of the statistics that came out of studies about romantic relationships. I'm single now, and re-examining a lot of the ideas that I've come across in the last couple decades of my life. Here's one that I've always come across, and despised, but decided to remain silent on: that people who are single don't live as long as those who get married and stay in committed relationships.</div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, I understand that you have the right to do whatever study you want about whatever, and its the purview of Internet journalism to responsibly report on these things to us, but here's my response: <i>stop telling people they're going to die years earlier than they would if they had found a mate</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is this true? I have no idea. I didn't even bother Googling around to figure out where this notion originated, how the study was constructed, whether or not the results were actually statistically significant, etc, etc. In all honesty, I do not care. It's far outside the scope of this blog post for me to make the case that monogamy is natural versus unnatural. What I do know is quite <i>unnatural</i>&nbsp;is instilling a sense of anxiety in people about the fact that they're going to die early unless they find someone to settle down with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's imagine that this is true: single people have, on average, much shorter lifespans than married people. In this case, it's probably fair asking the question as to whether or not the cultural stigma of being a single person is not only <i>causing</i> the results of the studies, and whether the studies themselves are accepted by people as a result of the cultural stigma itself? I'd suspect that academia has a term in its glossary for this kind of sociological feedback loop, though I'm not sure what it is.</div><div><br /></div><div>Stop reporting this kind of thing, and as a culture, let's stop believing it. I'm not dating at the moment, and I'm well aware that there's <i>nothing</i> wrong with being single. &nbsp;It's unclear to me whether or not I'm going to rush into dating in the distant future, but when I do, I'd really rather not have to wade through a bunch of women who are going on dates with me merely because they have some neurosis about dying early unless they find a man.</div><div><br /></div><div>And besides, if you're worried about longevity and you're single, you can just get a dog. Right? <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">:P</span></div>

        Here's my favorite piece of writing advice that I've ever heard:<br /><br />"Give the audience one and one, let them make two, and they'll love you for it forever."<br /><br />As writers, we're advised to avoid tautologies. This goes one step further. We shouldn't just avoid saying the same thing twice. We should leave out pieces of information, gaps that the reader must fill in with their own understanding.<br /><br />(I should point out that I've never studied writing; I just play a writer on the Internet.)

        A few months ago I <a href="/2016/01/09/christianity-in-nutshell-from-nut.html" target="_blank">wrote about Christianity</a>. That post was intended to be a sardonic tome that straddled the middle ground between believers and unbelievers, pointing out that one can easily find meaning in Christian scripture while at the same time calling into question its authority by deriding the authenticity of several of its claims.<br /><br />I began studying the Christian religion because I wanted to answer one fundamental question: why is it that, 2000 years after this man lived, do we all know who he is? Did he plan this legacy? Was it some kind of circumstantial accident? I was curious about the historical set of events that makes him a household name around the world, and a prophet whose&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/04/24/jesus-pancake-cowgirl-cafe-california/8100659/" target="_blank">face appears on pancakes</a>.<br /><br />A religious friend of mine asked me what my interest was in Christianity when he caught wind that I was investigating it, and I told him this. How is it his name has stuck around for this long? His reply to me was simple and, dare I say, not unexpected: "Because He was the son of God."<br /><br />I'm not saying this is the wrong answer, but for my purposes, it was a cop-out. Whether or not Jesus was just a man who has come to be worshipped by the multitudes, or was the actual son of God, I'm curious as to what methods he employed to get his point across. Ordinary fellow or god-fellow, what did he do to leave such an impression on his contemporaries?<br /><br />For me, things became much more clear after I watched David Batty's <i>The Gospel of John</i>. Early on, I avoided consuming TV versions of biblical accounts, since I didn't want visual interpretations of others to influence my understanding, which I felt should really come from reading what was written. I went so far as to learning some basic koine Greek, and the New Testament I carted around with me was an interlinear Greek-English version. Jesus didn't write a single word of the New Testament, but I'm only pointing out that I made an earnest effort to get as close to what might be called the "original source" as possible.<br /><br /><i>The Gospel of John</i>&nbsp;was different than other televised interpretations in that its narration is taken word-for-word from John's Gospel. The actors in the film actually look people in the ancient Middle East, they speak Aramaic, and they merely act out the actions of the narration from scripture. It's about as close as you're going to get to having a contemporary rendition of a Gospel accurately portray what's in the writing.<br /><br />So what did this film make clear to me? The true nature of the dialogues that Jesus has with the Pharisees, the members of the Jewish ruling council of his day. When I read these passages, I somehow envisioned Jesus sitting in a conference room at a table with the Pharisees, calmly swapping opinions. In the film, these are confrontations that take place publicly in the temple in Jerusalem. They are openly hostile debates in which Jesus is verbally rebuking the Pharisees for their hypocrisy, for abusing their power, and for losing sight of what they claim is their very mission, namely, serving the God they purport to worship.<br /><br />In hindsight, this should have been obvious to me. Most of these scenes end with the Pharisees picking up stones with which to stone Jesus for what he's saying to them, and each time, Jesus somehow manages to escape being stoned. They clearly weren't civil discussions. Parenthetically, it's interesting to me that no account actually describes <i>how</i>&nbsp;Jesus escapes these situations; the details are very handwavy. Perhaps, being the magical miracle man that he was, he dodged their stones like Neo dodged the bullets of the agents in the <i>The Matrix</i>.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is the story about Jesus and the cleansing of the Temple, the one story in the Bible in which Jesus resorts to physical aggression and violence in order to make his point. If the account can be believed, this is probably the incident for which, above all others, he was killed by the authorities. I find it strange that people regard Jesus as a peaceful person, but this event exists plainly in all four Gospel accounts of him.<br /><br />I recently read Reza Aslan's book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812981480/" target="_blank">Zealot</a></i>, which is a book that does precisely what I've been trying to do myself for the last couple of years: reconcile what's written in the Bible with what historians know about the historical Jesus. From my reading of the New Testament, it does seem that the Gospels written about Jesus do reflect some events that might have occurred, and they concern a man who probably existed. But you do get the sense that some of the stuff is embellished or fabricated, simply due to the inconsistencies in how Jesus is portrayed from chapter to chapter, and between the different books.<br /><br />For people who would like a compellingly readable account of how the events surrounding the historical Jesus lead to scripture being what it is, I'd recommend Aslan's book. I'd surmise that Aslan himself is not a Christian believer; he's an academic. I point this out because I've learned that this distinction matters to people when they're choosing to read one thing or another about Jesus.<br /><br />The title of the book comes from a Jewish sect of the day, a group of people who called themselves Zealots. This was a radical movement to incite the Jewish population in Jerusalem to rebel and overthrow the Romans who occupied the city. They were known to carry daggers, and were not opposed to the use of physical force in order to achieve their desired end. One of Jesus' own 12 apostles was Simon the Zealot. That Jesus was a political and / or social revolutionary is not a stretch in my mind, whether you go by scripture as absolute truth or the chronology pieced together from other sources by historians.<br /><br />The most interesting conclusion in Aslan's book pertains to the Epistle of James. The author of this book in the New Testament may not have been James, but it was at least someone who wrote it in order to honor James and espouse his teachings. So who was James? Jesus had an apostle named James, but historians tend to believe that the James to which this epistle belongs is Jesus' brother, James the Just. After Jesus was killed, the leadership of his movement was likely transferred to his brother James; this would have been consistent with dynasty customs of the day.<br /><br />Aslan makes a very interesting point: assuming that Jesus and James shared a common worldview, then the Epistle of James might very well be a close link we have to what Jesus believed and taught. The Gospels themselves were composed and constructed with a certain agenda; and inescapably, so too was James' Epistle. But it seems less likely that this lone epistle would have been co-opted and its contents changed or distorted than the accounts of Jesus in the Gospels.<br /><br />While most of the epistles in the New Testament talk about the importance of love, about belief in Jesus, and the importance of congregating for worship, the Epistle of James is passionate about action to help the poor. "Faith without works is dead!" (2:20) is a passage that summarizes its position. It decries the complacent lifestyles of the rich and famous, and advocates individual responsibility for helping the less fortunate. It is the one book in the New Testament that most parallels the contents of the Jewish Book of Proverbs or the Buddhist's Dhammapada, in that it seems to primarily espouse wisdom that suggests the reader should live a life beyond mere consideration for self.<br /><br />It's resolutely clear to me that when you cut through the cloud of rhetoric that surrounds the Christian religion, Jesus himself was a man of action. Many parts of Christian scripture seem to portray Jesus as an agitator, a poor Galilean peasant who sought to overturn the established order of his day. There's an oft-quoted aphorism you'll see on car bumpers that reads "Well-behaved women seldom make history." So too is it with men.

        Being the complete and total geek that I am, I always carry pens with me in the front pockets of my jeans. Sooner or later, the cap comes off of one of them and the front of my jeans gets stained with blobs of ink.<br /><br />Despite this, I continue to wear the jeans. Sure, I <i>could</i>&nbsp;replace them, but if I'm meeting someone new for the first time, and they're sizing me up, I think having the blobs of ink stains on the front of my jeans accurately reflects the kind of person I am.
