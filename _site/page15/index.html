        Here's a quote I saw painted on a door at a local community college. I've heard it before, and chances are good that you've read it several times before as well. Doesn't matter if you've read it 6,000 times and this is the 6,001st time you've seen it, here it is again:<br /><br /><em>"Art is either plagiarism or revolution."</em> -Paul Gauguin<br /><br />Now that's brilliant in its brevity. I don't care whether or not you even consider yourself to be an artist...the work you do, whatever it might be, could benefit greatly from figuring out how Gauguin's words apply to it.

        People never respond well to criticism of their actions. <br /><br />There are some people with the patience of saints who will hear you out if you start telling them what they're doing wrong. They might even listen to you. But in response to nothing but criticism, they'll probably end up not liking you, even secretly.<br /><br />Why on earth, then, is it standard practice for people to call and complain to a manager when they have a bad experience with an employee? Is this going to improve things?<br /><br />I have a "bad" customer service experience almost daily. Some interaction with a human being, either by phone or in person. My strategy in these situations is the same 96% of the time: <em>completely ignore them</em>.<br /><br />You might have a bottle of water with some mud at the bottom. Provided you don't stir up the contents of the bottle, you can drink the water without getting any dirt in your mouth.<br /><br />The posture in these situations should not be to find the bad and try to stamp it out by mentioning it. When we experience good customer service, we take it for granted and accept it as expected, but I think when someone exceeds or even meets our expectations with a kind attitude, that's when we ought to be demanding to talk to the manager.<br /><br />"This employee was extremely helpful and brightened my day. Thanks."<br /><br />(It just might have the power to create good vibes, on an otherwise unlucky Friday the 13th.)

        After paying for taxes, rent, food, and other necessities of life, the money you have left to spend is often referred to as "disposable income".<br /><br />The insinuation of this widely pervasive phrase is simple: that you should dispose of it. This smacks of an inclination to be a consumer: go down to the Sharper Image and buy the vibrating pad for a chair that massages your butt.<br /><br />I have no problem with electric butt massagers, but it seems like we could change the phrase to set people's ambitions a little higher. "Savable income", perhaps? Or maybe "dispensable income", implying that it could be allocated to parts of society where it's sorely needed.<br /><br />Words are small, but they can have a massive impact.

        When I first got to college, Napster was all the rage. It was around that time that Lars Ulrich came out and started publicly deriding the company for letting people download their music, or the music of any other artist, without their consent and without paying for it. At the time, I heard the question a lot: "Is it wrong to download music?" I didn't realize it at the time, but this was the wrong question. It was, at best, a distraction. <br /><br />Lars and the rest of his Metallica buddies didn't read their history books. When the radio first became widespread in the 1920's and 30's, the music industries faced a similar panic. Suddenly, people had a device in their homes that would allow them to get music streamed to them invisibly through the air. Predictably, the companies producing hard copies of music were worried this would dampen sales. They started putting a sticker on their music: "NOT FOR RADIO BROADCAST". They fought the legality of broadcasting their music in court. Legally, they lost the battle in a Supreme Court ruling. <br /><br />What they didn't realize until a little later was that the radio, as a <em>platform</em>, was actually the best promotion tool to come along in years. It was the best possible way to get new music in front of an audience, increasing exposure and potentially increase the sale of hard copies of music.<br /><br />First takeaway: popular technology is riddled with inevitability. After the Napster floodgates were opened, it was naive to think they could be litigated shut again. <br /><br />The world is much different now than when the radio first came onto the scene, and things are changing much quicker than they were back then. My brother plays bass in a band, and given the current state of the music industry, it's unlikely that he's going to be "discovered" by a music industry executive anytime soon. Is this a tragedy? Hardly. He's a smart kid, and he (and others like him) are going to figure out how to leverage the world <em>as it is</em> to pave success for themselves.<br /><br />Borders is slowly bleeding to death in public as e-readers seem to be taking over the market. Does this mean that bibliophiles (like moi) aren't going to a physical location to spend money on books? The independent bookstores that have been cowering in the shadows for the last 10 or 20 years now have to plot their next move. <br /><br />Watching movies is a good deal more comfortable at home, and with the technology now, the quality is comprable. Just because you have a large screen, projector, and a movie that I won't be able to buy on DVD for another few months is no reason for me to pay 10 dollars. (But: I <em>do</em> have 10 dollars to spend on something more compelling.)<br /><br />The radio is a reality. Fight it at your peril.

        True randomness doesn't always feel random. People swear up and down that their iPods, when placed on shuffle, favor certain songs over others.<br /><br />This isn't device error, but user error. The iPod doesn't keep track of the songs it played before. After each song ends, it just scans the list and picks another track at random. Since it's ignorant of which song played five songs ago, that song is fair game...as are any other songs off of the same album or from the same artist. When that happens, the user detects a "pattern" that isn't quite there.<br /><br />It's definitely happened to me. I only have a single song by the 1970's band Slade on my iPod, and yet it seems to play with a disproportionately high frequency when I've got my iPod in shuffle mode. I know it's just coincidence, but the part of my brain that's inclined to avoid black cats and walking under ladders suspects otherwise.<br /><br />I'm really surprised that Apple hasn't made shuffle mode something that isn't truly random. Why not keep track of the shuffle play history and space out the tracks by artist? <br /><br />The biggest challenge of technology, any technology, is to match its performance with the (reasonable) expectations of the user.

        I learned the following "fact" several times while I was in school: in the first year of your life, right after you're born, you are capable of learning a certain amount of information. With learning to walk and motor functions, there is a lot to take in.<br /><br />In the second year of your life, you can only learn half that much. And the year after that, in your third year, half as much as the second year. So, the amount your brain is capable of learning cuts in half each year, becoming an asymptote as you hit middle age.<br /><br />I don't believe this for one second, and I really don't care how much scientific evidence there is backing it up, I don't buy it.<br /><br />For one thing, I don't believe in telling people they have limitations. The more you tell someone they're incapable of doing something, the more likely they are to believe you and accept that they are, in fact, incapable. I think that spreading the notion that once you reach a certain age that you're stuck where you are is irresponsible. (I know that once someone hits the age of 85, they may very well be stuck where they are, but I'm not talking about people <em>that</em> old.)<br /><br />It is not good practice to build resignation into middle age. This does more harm than good. Better to tell people they have a fighting chance if they try than to discourage them from trying at all.

        This is, of course, not the kind of lead time that we get when we lose our jobs. Whether you're being let go because management thinks you're longer a good fit for the position, or if you're laid off because of lack of work, or if you're terminated just because you're an incompetent boob, it doesn't matter. We don't get a lot of time.<br /><br />It happens, suddenly. And only when it happens do we start to think about our next job. We start to panic, and realize that getting the next job is going to take a lot of work. We weren't ready, because it was unexpected.<br /><br />The time to panic about your next job is not when you suddenly lose your job six months from now. (And it could happen to almost any one of us, in these times.) The time to panic about it is <em>right now</em>, before you need to panic.<br /><br />Far be it from me to be dolling out life advice to anyone who might be reading this, but I've always been wary of comfort. I get uncomfortable with being comfortable. Life isn't supposed to be easy. A lot (not all) of the stories I hear about people caught off guard happened because they let their guard down in the first place.<br /><br />I think if you manage to go an entire month at a job without feeling any pangs of stress, you should let it worry you.

        Mirror neurons are serious business.<br /><br />At least, that's the way you <em>should</em> be looking at it. Hanging out with boring, dull, predictable people who are unable to shut up for more than 10 seconds might be annoying, and it isn't likely to cause you to instantly act like them, but...<br /><br />...but over time, though, you do absorb the qualities of the company that you keep. <br /><br />This is an immensely important piece of information, because we all care a great deal about how we come off to others. Since this is weighted so heavily on the people we associate with, this small tidbit of social psychology should guide every major life decision we make. (Career, personal network, friends, mate.)<br /><br />It probably means that first impression, that "vibe" we get from people before we let our heads get in the way, is something that we should be paying attention to. More importantly, probably wouldn't hurt to work <em>religiously</em> on the first impression you give off.

        There's a policy at Google that insists that their engineers spend one day per week, on company time, working on a personal project. If you look at this from the perspective of a bean counter, that means 20% of their engineering budget is allocated to letting their engineers hack on technology, whether or not Google stands to benefit from it directly.<br /><br />The reason they do this, as any person who appreciates the creative process already knows, is that they're chasing serendipity. Creativity is non-linear. Getting good ideas from your employees is more likely to happen if you disband some of the structure of your organization instead of re-structuring it.<br /><br />So far, it's worked pretty well. Google News and Gmail were both started as small projects conceived of and developed during 20% time. Both of them have worked out well for Google.<br /><br />A lot of companies are inclined to scoff at this. "Why should we pay to give people time and space to learn new things or improve themselves?" They regard this sort of thing as something that should be done off the clock, but the employees on their own personal time. Especially given the very real fear that the employee will eventually leave and go work for someone else?<br /><br />To that question, I'd pose another: is it worse to incur the expense of letting someone grow and then losing them as an employee, or to avoid the expense of self-improvement altogether and keep them around?

        My girlfriend told me about an excellent idea she had. Actually, there are two, but they're to be taken together:<br /><br />1. Start your Christmas shopping now (before the rush.)<br /><br />2. Do your shopping on Kickstarter.com<br /><br />I think this is a great idea. I've been telling everyone I meet about Kickstarter, and that everyone should be planning something to get crowdfunded using the site.<br /><br />But using it for shopping, especially for gifts, makes a lot of sense, simply because it brings together so many wacky ideas by creative people. If you're looking for something unique and interesting for your aunt, that's unlikely to be mass-produced and sold at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for your aunt, you can probably find something both quirky and up her alley on Kickstarter.<br /><br />They make such interesting gifts because you're not just buying a <em>thing</em>...you're also buying the story that goes with it.
