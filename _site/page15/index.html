                      Here's a quote I saw painted on a door at a local community college. I've heard it before, and chances are good that you've read it several times before as well. Doesn't matter if you've read it 6,000 times and this is the 6,001st time you've seen it, here it is again:"Art is either plagiarism or revolution." -Paul GauguinNow that's brilliant in its brevity.

                      People never respond well to criticism of their actions. There are some people with the patience of saints who will hear you out if you start telling them what they're doing wrong. They might even listen to you. But in response to nothing but criticism, they'll probably end up not liking you, even secretly.Why on earth, then, is it standard practice for people to call and complain to a manager when they have a bad...

                      After paying for taxes, rent, food, and other necessities of life, the money you have left to spend is often referred to as "disposable income".The insinuation of this widely pervasive phrase is simple: that you should dispose of it. This smacks of an inclination to be a consumer: go down to the Sharper Image and buy the vibrating pad for a chair that massages your butt.I have no problem with electric butt massagers, but it...

                      When I first got to college, Napster was all the rage. It was around that time that Lars Ulrich came out and started publicly deriding the company for letting people download their music, or the music of any other artist, without their consent and without paying for it. At the time, I heard the question a lot: "Is it wrong to download music?" I didn't realize it at the time, but this was the wrong...

                      True randomness doesn't always feel random. People swear up and down that their iPods, when placed on shuffle, favor certain songs over others.This isn't device error, but user error. The iPod doesn't keep track of the songs it played before. After each song ends, it just scans the list and picks another track at random. Since it's ignorant of which song played five songs ago, that song is fair game...as are any other songs off...

                      I learned the following "fact" several times while I was in school: in the first year of your life, right after you're born, you are capable of learning a certain amount of information. With learning to walk and motor functions, there is a lot to take in.In the second year of your life, you can only learn half that much. And the year after that, in your third year, half as much as the second...

                      This is, of course, not the kind of lead time that we get when we lose our jobs. Whether you're being let go because management thinks you're longer a good fit for the position, or if you're laid off because of lack of work, or if you're terminated just because you're an incompetent boob, it doesn't matter. We don't get a lot of time.It happens, suddenly. And only when it happens do we start to...

                      Mirror neurons are serious business.At least, that's the way you should be looking at it. Hanging out with boring, dull, predictable people who are unable to shut up for more than 10 seconds might be annoying, and it isn't likely to cause you to instantly act like them, but......but over time, though, you do absorb the qualities of the company that you keep. This is an immensely important piece of information, because we all care...

                      There's a policy at Google that insists that their engineers spend one day per week, on company time, working on a personal project. If you look at this from the perspective of a bean counter, that means 20% of their engineering budget is allocated to letting their engineers hack on technology, whether or not Google stands to benefit from it directly.The reason they do this, as any person who appreciates the creative process already knows,...

                      My girlfriend told me about an excellent idea she had. Actually, there are two, but they're to be taken together:1. Start your Christmas shopping now (before the rush.)2. Do your shopping on Kickstarter.comI think this is a great idea. I've been telling everyone I meet about Kickstarter, and that everyone should be planning something to get crowdfunded using the site.But using it for shopping, especially for gifts, makes a lot of sense, simply because it...
