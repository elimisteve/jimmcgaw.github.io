        We tell teenagers it's "power". Celebrities go on television and tell kids on small spots that studying is a quick road to empowerment. <br /><br />The problem with power is that it's an abstract concept. It's not as concrete as it could be, and it's very difficult for a teenager to discern from that message exactly what they stand to gain by trying harder in school.<br /><br />Here's what I've learned: more knowledge means less of a chance that you have to ask for someone else's permission to do something. The less you rely on others, the more you can do whatever you want. I'm glad that I'm a web developer, because if I need to build a website, I can just go ahead and do it. Much less stands in my way.<br /><br />Empowerment, then, is about the ability to skirt authority. If you frame the message in those terms, you'd have a pretty easy time convincing students they should study harder.

        If you watch for deals, it's possible to get a hotel room in a decent casino, right on the strip, for about $30 a night. You have to dig a little to find these kinds of deals, but they're out there. The casinos don't mind charging the low rates, because most of the guests end up dumping enough money into the slot machines during their stay to make up for what they might lose on the room itself. Not every guest gambles, but enough to in order to make it worth their while.<br /><br />This is, when you think about it, a novel concept. Hotel rooms are, effectively, a commodity. You get a bed, bathroom, and possibly a mini-bar for the evening, and while some are nicer than others, it's hard to differentiate between any two hotel chains in any way other than one's personal preference (which is subjective) and cost. <br /><br />Las Vegas hotels have learned they can pull people in and charge them less for a room because the overall cost of running the hotel is subsidized by the gambling of the guests. If you leave Vegas and think about all the hotels in the lonely stretch of Route 66 running through the Midwest, I'm surprised more of them haven't tried to adopt this model in other ways. <br /><br />Sure, for a lot of people, hotels are just the place you sleep on your way from Point A to Point B, but what about the families or people who are just dying to have a more interesting experience before they fall asleep in their rooms? Granted, Vegas works partly because it's a bastion of sin where people come to spend money on things that are illegal or otherwise unavailable elsewhere, but little offerings could be a big draw for your average hotel. Some of them could easily be turned into profit centers. Think golf; plastic ball pits for adults; laser tag. <br /><br />My personal favorite was at the Hyatt in San Diego: offer a gas-powered marshmallow roasting pit and sell S'more kits at the front desk. That's an easy addition that almost any hotel could afford to their outdoor pool area.

        Back when I was in college, a friend and I were having a discussion over a case of beers about how you could defraud lots of people. We weren't really planning to try and do it, but we were just tossing around the ideas of Ponzi schemes, multi-level marketing schemes like Amway, and basically any other white-collar equivalent of the pigeon drop.<br /><br />My friend old me about an age-old con: you acquire a very large spam list of email addresses and start sending them periodic emails. You pick an event in the stock market that in which two things can occur; in his example, it was picking whether a particular stock will go up in a given month. Let's say its Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). You split the list of emails in half the first month. To the first half, you tell them that Apple's stock will increase in valuation per share. To the second half, you tell them the opposite: that it will go down in value. <br /><br />At the end of that first month, you have (in theory) half of that spam list believing that you predicted the stock's movement in valuation accurately. You scrap the half to whom you sent the incorrect prediction, and repeat the process with the other half in the following month. <br /><br />If you start with 40,000 emails, and do this for six months, you end up with 625 people who've received emails from that made accurate "predictions" about the movement of Apple's stock valuation in the past six months. At that point, you try and convince the 625 of them that you're an experienced money manager that is able to make accurate predictions (instead of random guesses) about stocks and try to get investment money from them.<br /><br />The logic behind this con struck a chord with me. It was a terrible idea to try and execute for all kinds of reasons, (again, the intent was never to actually do it. We were just bored and partly drunk college kids) but it turned on some lights in my head. I started to think about the guys on Wall Street who are responsible for analyzing stocks and making similar such "predictions" with other people's money. <br /><br />I'm not saying that all financial investors are dishonest schemers, or even gamblers. But what I started to think about was the pool of investors as a whole. They are, doubtless, a large group of diverse people with a common goal: to make lots of money in a short period of time. Let's say you start with 40,000 of them, and turn them loose to invest in the stock market with lots of money. Imagine they have little else to go on besides guessing, at random, at what time and in which stocks they should invest in to yield a positive return.<br /><br />If you do that, and the pool of investors is large enough, then some portion of them are bound to guess correctly. They'll make money. But the problem comes with two things. The first is visibilitiy. Most likely, we'll only hear about the winning investors while the rest of them are quietly dismissed (this is called <em>survivorship bias</em>.)<br /><br />The second problem is attribution: if you perceive the success of those few as being a function of their intelligence as investors, <em>instead of</em> good luck, then as a manager responsible for those investors, you might start making bad decisions. You fire those that lost money, for example, because you interpret their bad luck as incompetence. But more importantly, you might have acquired a false sense of trust about the investors who guessed correctly...and give them more money to manage.<br /><br />In my younger days, I wrote off this thought as being something that was possible or even likely, but difficult for me to verify. I wasn't (and still am not) trained as an investor. I assumed that people who managed investment funds had studied economics and financial markets and generally had a pretty good grasp on what they were doing. (Warren Buffet can't just be the luckiest guy on the planet.)<br /><br />In the book <em>Fooled by Randomness</em>, Nassim Taleb explores this idea in great detail. As an investor himself, and someone who is very familiar with probability and statistics, Taleb expresses his concern for the fact that a lot of otherwise bright people seem to make this error in attribution. The lucky investors, who made good decisions or avoided making catastrophically bad decisions, come out on top, and we hear about them and their (apparent) brilliance in predicting how the stock market will work.<br /><br />Using the texts of Nostrodomous to pick stock tips is also a bad idea. The direction stocks take doesn't follow the patterns set by astrology. Numerology won't crack tomorrow's valuation of Apple. But as humans, we're pretty good at finding patterns in things, especially when we want to. This would a tough sell to a Wall Street speculator. As Upton Sinclair once said: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"<br /><br />No wonder we're in such a mess.

        There's a great book I read recently called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159184259X/">Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys To Creativity</a> by Hugh MacLeod. It's a quick read; most of its insights are in the small illustrations (which are the author's craft), which take up roughly half the pages in the book. I picked it up in the bookstore and had finished reading it within 45 minutes. <br /><br />Despite that, I still bought the book, with the intention of re-reading it and then passing it along to a friend. I still haven't been able to bring myself to give it away. It's quite a good book.<br /><br />In one chapter, the Hugh talks about living in the same apartment building as Tim Burton for brief period of time in the late 1980s. They spoke a few times. During one conversation, he asked Tim Burton about pursing a career in the arts. Tim said, "If you have the creative bug, it isn't ever going to go away. I'd just get used to the idea of dealing with it."<br /><br />Good advice, but incomplete: all of us have the creative bug at least part of the time. Some people have it more often than others. It's not an inborn trait in a few rare individuals, but a state of mind that afflicts us when we least expect it. <br /><br />You have the creative bug. And the first step in getting used to it is recognizing it when it strikes.

        I had a friend in middle school who loved the Beach Boys. Here's a quote from what was his favorite song of the same name:<br /><br />"I guess I just wasn't made for these times."<br /><br />It's pretty easy to attribute a failure in finding your place in the world to some flaw in the world itself. Defeat means not having to try anymore.

        Want to know one way you can increase compliance when the honor system is at play? Hang up a set of eyes.<br /><br /><div style="float:left;"><br /><img style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;width: 320px;height:320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/TDlaLfilpdI/AAAAAAAAAM8/iqhxfCte6yI/s320/pet-rocks.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5492520374046664146" /><br /></div><br /><br />There was once a vendor who stocked office break rooms with pretzels. He'd leave the pretzels, along with a locked box, and then leave for the day. People were supposed to take a pretzel and put a dollar into the box. At the end of the day, he'd come back and collect the money from the box.<br /><br />Given a system that's so easy to cheat, you might be wondering how many people took pretzels without leaving a dollar. Turns out, most people were pretty honest, but there was always some theft occurring. (Interestingly, this theft increased as Christmas approached.) <br /><br />What he found (Lord only knows how he thought to test this) was that if he hung up a set of eyes close to the pretzels, the amount of theft dropped dramatically. It didn't matter whose eyes they were. The mere <em>presence</em> of eyes, even cut out of a magazine, made people more honest.<br /><br />We seem to behave better when we feel that someone is watching us.<br /><br />A few days ago, I stumbled across <a href="http://googlyeyewatch.blogspot.com/">this blog that features pictures of googly-eyes glued in random places and to random things</a>. It's a great idea for a blog, the pictures are hilarious, and if you're on Windows XP, I recommend you download your favorite ones and make your screensaver a slideshow of them. (I'm a little peeved at myself for not thinking of the idea first.) <br /><br />But it occurred to me that this is a pretty silly little game that most of us can play. You can buy these googly-eyes at just about any craft store, or if all else fails, you can buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018NBMKU/">125 self-adhesive googly-eyes on Amazon for less than two bucks</a>. (The shipping charge is a little outrageous, but arguably worth it.)<br /><br />I bought five packs of these and am going to descend upon my town with them. I'm going to put them everywhere. I think it's a fun little creative exercise: what can you make look like face with some silly eyes?<br /><br />And I don't know how effective googly-eyes are at changing people's behavior, but maybe we can get people to behave a little better.

        Do you know how many calories you're supposed to consume in a day or, more importantly, how many calories you actually eat in an average day? Most people don't. We just try to eat the best food we can, keep portions small, and hope that our caloric expenditure outweighs our intake.<br /><br />FDA labels on food packaging are of little use to the average person. If you happen to be the type of person who likes creating spreadsheets, tracking and aggregating data about how many calories you eat and burn in a day might be fun, but for the rest of us, keeping track of all those numbers is too much of a headache to handle. <br /><br />I'm glad that FDA labels are required by law, because I always favor transparency...but now that we have that data available to us, what are we supposed to do with it all. Does it really make us, as eaters of that food, healthier or better off in some way?<br /><br />I read an article once about a redesign of packaging for over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, with color coded, simple labels that read "I Have a Headache" or "I Have a Cold" or "I Have Sinus Allergies". The idea was simple: instead of expecting people to remember brand names, have people be able to pick out a medicine based on their affliction. Someone who wants a pain reliever might reach for Tylenol, but that requires that the consumer's brain has the Tylenol brand mapped to pain relief. <br /><br />Branding experts will tell you that this generic approach to medicine won't work. Brand names are a more effective and trusted shortcut for most people to remember, instead of labeling medicine with the symptoms they treat. Even if that isn't true, it's probably just as well we don't try and foster a society in which people are grabbing the box that says "Headache medicine" without taking the time to figure out what's in it. (Okay, so that's Excedrin slogan...maybe that <em>is</em> the society in which we live.)<br /><br />But what about for nutritional information? Numbers are a little bit too much for people to handle, but what about color coding the contents of food on the label? Better yet, have colors represent "Good" or "Bad" in terms of percentage of daily allowance. If something is extremely high in sodium, and we know that sodium in high quantities is shown to be correlated with an increase in blood pressure, which is a bad thing, then highlight the information in red. If something has a lot of fiber in it, and fiber intake is, generally, a good thing, then have that labeled in green. Create different color "zones" for each nutritional ingredient listed. You could also create "flags" that appear on items with notoriously bad ingredients, like high-fructose corn syrup. <br /><br />People don't think in numbers very well, but we are visual creatures. I would think there was a way to improve the existing FDA label system so that people other than number crunchers could start to be mindful of what it is that they're eating.<br /><br />Then again, warning labels on cigarettes don't usually work. Maybe I'm going off half-cocked.

        I was having a conversation about local musicians with a (somewhat older) friend of mine. He was remarking about how talented a lot of street musicians are, and how he hoped that one day, the best of them would be discovered by a talent scout in the recording industry.<br /><br />"Why?" I asked him plainly. "So said record company can take a huge chunk of their earnings for themselves?"<br /><br />He clearly didn't like this set of questions, so I went on to explain that any musician or band in this day and age is perfectly capable of recording, producing, mixing, mastering, and distributing their music without any help from a major record label. He shook his head. "There are still some things a band can't do for themselves, Jim. Marketing, distribution, all of those things require the resources of a big company."<br /><br />If I didn't know any better (and I probably don't), I'd say he almost felt sorry for me for being so naive.<br /><br />Take the band Hawthorne Heights...they're not my favorite musical act by a wide margin, but they are a band that formed, wrote and recorded their music on their own, and developed a fan base using interactions with fans through social media. That's where the marketing and distribution happened, too.<br /><br />It didn't take a lot of money, but it wasn't easy. Building a commercially successful band from nothing involves a lot of sweat equity. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it can be done. In a world where the Internet provides a decent alternative, getting offered a contract from a record label isn't necessarily a ticket to freedom. Just as likely, it could end up putting the band in an artistically constricting situation that isn't nearly worth what it's costing them.<br /><br />Why, then, do so many musicians believe that they need to wait for someone in a suit and tie to validate their work? Is it some form of learned helplessness that parallels Stockholm syndrome?

        We generally interpret that question as an assault on our egos. If someone asks us to consider even the possibility that we're wrong, either about an opinion or a proposed course of action, we get very defensive. <br /><br />It's very difficult to tell or suggest to another person that they're wrong. Chances are, you won't change their mind. If anything, you may end up having the opposite effect: the more defensive a person is acting, the less likely they are to reconsider, or even think about, exactly what it is they're defending.<br /><br />I think considering the possibility that you might be wrong can often serve as the ultimate escape route. We get to a point where we're clinging to what we (think we) know and have trouble letting go. But being wrong can be a relief...so long as you ask it of yourself before someone else does. Then, it's an argument.<br /><br />It's the question I (try to) never stop asking myself.
