                      Paul Orfalea started Kinko's in Southern California back in 1970, and quickly expanded his simple copy-shop operation into several stores. His management style was rather unique. By his own admission, he felt under-qualified to tell the people running each of his stores what to do, so he left the stores to their own devices, without issuing a lot of top-down directives.Instead, he traveled around between the stores and learned from each store manager. He listened...

                      We tell teenagers it's "power". Celebrities go on television and tell kids on small spots that studying is a quick road to empowerment. The problem with power is that it's an abstract concept. It's not as concrete as it could be, and it's very difficult for a teenager to discern from that message exactly what they stand to gain by trying harder in school.Here's what I've learned: more knowledge means less of a chance that...

                      If you watch for deals, it's possible to get a hotel room in a decent casino, right on the strip, for about $30 a night. You have to dig a little to find these kinds of deals, but they're out there. The casinos don't mind charging the low rates, because most of the guests end up dumping enough money into the slot machines during their stay to make up for what they might lose on...

                      Back when I was in college, a friend and I were having a discussion over a case of beers about how you could defraud lots of people. We weren't really planning to try and do it, but we were just tossing around the ideas of Ponzi schemes, multi-level marketing schemes like Amway, and basically any other white-collar equivalent of the pigeon drop.My friend old me about an age-old con: you acquire a very large spam...

                      There's a great book I read recently called Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys To Creativity by Hugh MacLeod. It's a quick read; most of its insights are in the small illustrations (which are the author's craft), which take up roughly half the pages in the book. I picked it up in the bookstore and had finished reading it within 45 minutes. Despite that, I still bought the book, with the intention of re-reading it...

                      I had a friend in middle school who loved the Beach Boys. Here's a quote from what was his favorite song of the same name:"I guess I just wasn't made for these times."It's pretty easy to attribute a failure in finding your place in the world to some flaw in the world itself. Defeat means not having to try anymore. Here's my retort to Brian Wilson's lamentation:"It's easier to wear slippers than it is to...

                      Take a second to reflect on your own personal view of human nature. How do you think we're wired? What motivates people?Once you reach your conclusion, try this: for one month, try doing something each day that's counter to your worldview about human nature.

                      Want to know one way you can increase compliance when the honor system is at play? Hang up a set of eyes.There was once a vendor who stocked office break rooms with pretzels. He'd leave the pretzels, along with a locked box, and then leave for the day. People were supposed to take a pretzel and put a dollar into the box. At the end of the day, he'd come back and collect the money...

                      Do you know how many calories you're supposed to consume in a day or, more importantly, how many calories you actually eat in an average day? Most people don't. We just try to eat the best food we can, keep portions small, and hope that our caloric expenditure outweighs our intake.FDA labels on food packaging are of little use to the average person.

                      I was having a conversation about local musicians with a (somewhat older) friend of mine. He was remarking about how talented a lot of street musicians are, and how he hoped that one day, the best of them would be discovered by a talent scout in the recording industry."Why?"
