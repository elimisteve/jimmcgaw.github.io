        One friend of mine on Facebook had the privilege of hearing Google's own Larry Page speak in public once. (She works for Google.) Afterwards, she posted a comment on her status to the effect of "Wow. Larry Page is a genius."<br /><br />Going into it, I'm sure she expected him to be very smart. In anticipation of seeing him speak, she imagined what one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the 21st century must be like. She expected him to be a genius. She expected that the words he spoke would be dripping with sheer brilliance. And so it was.<br /><br />Recently, I read about an experiment that some psychologists did, and it excited me, because it's something that I personally have always wanted to try. They took Joshua Bell, one of the world's best violin players, and had him perform in the subway in Washington D.C. Anyone who wasn't familiar with classical music walked right past. <br /><br />They weren't expecting to hear a world class violinist playing for spare change in the subway during their morning commute, so they didn't hear one.<br /><br />Think for a second about you expect to see on your way home from work today. Think about you expect to hear next time that co-worker next to you comes over and starts talking to you, or what your boss might say. We experience most things in life and interact with people around us on auto-pilot. Whatever you expect to see, chances are good that's what you're going to see.

        In the software world, lots of computer programmers load up their resumes with all the relevant acronyms, buzz words, and technologies that anyone might need. Lots of job posters are no better; since human resources doesn't understand the language they're attempting to speak, they err on the side of listing all of the buzz words, too. It's a wonder the right person ever gets hired for the right job, and that anything ever gets done.<br /><br />If I were a hiring manager in charge of recruiting people, I'd be very interested in reading a resume that contained an "anti-skill set" section. Sure, tell me what you're good at and what you excel at doing...but while you're at it, tell me what you're not good at or where your weaknesses lie. Tell me what you don't know.<br /><br />No one is perfect, no one knows everything, and you're no exception. I just want you to demonstrate that you're cognizant of it.

        If you grew up in the northern suburbs of Detroit, like I did, you might have heard of Art Castle. <br /><br />I went there once when I was very young for a classmate's birthday party. Basically, you pick a while plaster shape (I chose a T-Rex), paint it however you like, spray glitter on it, and then the thing is baked in some kind of oven, to solidify how you made it look. You get to take it home.<br /><br />The results were invariably terrible. They look almost as bad as <a href="http://www.artcastleonline.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc">their website</a>, which is horrendous.<br /><br />The point of the place is not to turn young minds into artists. It's not an art school. You don't go there to refine your technique or learn the methods that made Van Gogh famous. It's much egalitarian than that; anyone can go there, take a pre-shaped lump of plaster, and paint it however they please. It's a playground for people who want to do something artistic, but who don't want to buy their own equipment and learn a lot of new things.<br /><br />A purist would scoff at this. Of course it isn't "real" art. And that's okay. But there are plenty of things in this world that we take very, very seriously. And we often restrict the people who can participate to those who promise to take it seriously, who promise to get better at what they're doing, who promise to put in the work to become respectable.<br /><br />That works for a lot of businesses, but if you can let go of the purity of an idea, think about how you can turn what you love into a playground for others to play on.

        Does anyone remember a time when postage stamps used to cost 25 cents?<br /><br />I do. I remember it very distinctly because a series of postage stamps came out that had dinosaurs on them. Suddenly, the prospect of having to write all those thank-you notes to relatives after they sent me money and gifts on Christmas and my birthday became <em>really</em> exciting because I got to use one of these dinosaur stamps. Here was my favorite of the group:<br /><br /><img style="width: 182px; height: 145px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/S-dMVYmFflI/AAAAAAAAAMs/L6YHDQpfzfI/s200/unitedstates_1989_tyrannosaurus.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br /><br />I don't still have any of these, but if I did, they wouldn't be good any more. I'd either have to plaster on about 10 additional 2 cent stamps. Or I'd have to use two of them. The cost of postage has almost doubled since then.<br /><br />But here's the deal: if, instead of buying a 25 cent stamp in 1989, I had put that money into the bank, yada yada...it would be worth more now. You all know about compound interest and the time value of money, so I won't lecture you about it.<br /><br />But the same goes for the post office. If I didn't use a stamp in 1989, then they haven't incurred most of the expense that the stamp is supposed to be covering, so in theory, <em>they</em> should have invested the money, and so they should have more than 25 cents now. Chances are good the present value of 25 cents in 1989 would more than cover the price of a postage stamp now. So if I buy stamps today, logically, they should never go bad.<br /><br />Recently, the post office realized this, and they introduced the "Forever" line of stamps. You buy them at the current rate and they're good forever after. I just learned about this a few weeks ago. It's a good idea. In case anyone else missed the meeting, I thought I'd share it with the rest of you.

      <h1><a href="/2010/05/26/a-digital-ice-glass-method.html">A Digital Ice Glass Method</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">
        <span class="date">May 26, 2010</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        If you're having trouble controlling yourself as far as spending goes, I heard about the "ice glass" method in order to control your spending: put your credit card in a glass of water and then put it into the freezer. Next time your feel compelled to run out and buy a stack of clothes or shoes or electronics or whatever, there's a forced "cooling off" period, during which time you have to let the ice melt naturally before you can spend the money. (The microwave can't be used because it would corrupt the magnetic strip, and smashing the glass results in a mess.) By the time the card is thawed out, in theory, your impulse to buy whatever you wanted originally should be gone.<br /><br />Personally, if there's something that I spend too much money on, it's books. By far, the biggest expense I have that isn't essential (my car, rent, or utilities fall into that category) is the amount I'm spending on books on Amazon. I probably spend well over $100 per month on books in general. I read almost all of them, though, so I don't think it's compulsive spending, and I don't hoard them, so I'm not convinced that it's really a problem. (My girlfriend might disagree.)<br /><br />But my credit card number is stored with Amazon. Even if I froze my card, I could just as easily run to a computer and place a massive order for books without having to wait for the ice to melt. But what if Amazon allowed you to opt-in to a program where they "digitally freeze" your card on file, so that you had to wait an hour or so between the time you click "Checkout" from the shopping cart page and the time you could actually place the order? Or let customers set a "spending limit" each month. I could set mine at $80, and once I spend more than that, my card is frozen for all subsequent purchases. You could even create a page where you see an animation of the card, in an ice chunk, slowly dripping as it thawed out.<br /><br />It would make you think before you bought anything, even before you hit the spending limit. It creates an artificial scarcity in the money you can spend, so you start evaluating whether each purchase you're about to make is "worth it". It might not increase Amazon's sales, but would demonstrate a commitment to putting a small segment of customers and their needs first.

        I've been living in dorm rooms and apartment buildings for the past ten years of my life, and one of my biggest pain points is doing laundry. I've never had my own washer and dryer in the unit, so I either have to wait until the communal laundry room in my apartment complex is free, or I have to haul everything to a laundromat. (The laundromat isn't all bad.)<br /><br />Coordinating the use of the laundry room with all of my neighbors in the apartment complex is an odd thing. Very few of us have ever met each other personally, so you just wander down there to see if the machines are free. If so, you run back to your place, hoping that they're still free by the time you get back. Or if you arrive and see that the washers are in use, then you have to check back a little later, and just hope that the person with their stuff in the wash didn't get roped in a marathon of watching <em>Heroes</em> on DVD and forgot about their clothes.<br /><br />Coordination among strangers is an odd thing to accomplish, but I wonder if the whole workflow couldn't be made easier with some simple technological additions. The first problem is that the person doing their laundry really never knows for sure when their laundry is done, in either the washer or dryer. New units were just installed in my building, and while the old ones had timers that counted down (it took 38 minutes to do a load in the washing machine), the new ones don't offer any indication about how long the load will be. So the most convenient thing for me to do is wait longer than is reasonable, and <em>then</em> go check. This works, but it wastes time, potentially leaves the next person waiting for the machines longer than necessary.<br /><br />And even if washers do come equipped with a timer, and you know from the start that your load will take 38 minutes, people don't like doing that math. ("Okay, it's 6:37 now, which means that it will be ready at...um...") And you may still lose track of the time.<br /><br />What about those coasters they give you when you're waiting for a table at restaurants? Would it be terribly difficult to work those into the mix so that a person gets a similar coaster that buzzes when their load is ready? Some kind of alerting system would certainly decrease a lot of the lag time between the machine cycle finish and when the owner returns to claim the laundry.<br /><br />And the alerting system could be used to let people other people in the complex know when the current load in the wash has finished, so they can plan to bring their own loads down shortly after. Or, if I'm done using the washing machines for the day, and I notice that the second alert coaster is gone (meaning that someone else is currently waiting for the machines), I could push a button to send a signal letting them know they were now free.<br /><br />Of course, this overall proposal suggests that the solution to the problem is to avoid talking directly with any of our neighbors. Perhaps it's just the programmer in my talking, and I'm inclined to think that a technical solution is better than mere face-to-face communication. I still think there's potential here.

        People seem to like it a lot when I write my opinions about Facebook, so today I'm going to offer you a quick clean-up tip. It will take you a few minutes to do and <br /><br />Over the course of time, most of us that use Facebook on a daily basis end up accumulating a bunch of Facebook Apps. We see our friends taking a quiz that reveals which "Lost" character you would be, and we end up installing the app and taking the quiz, because it's more fun than working.<br /><br />People don't read what they agree to when they reach the old "Allow This App?" prompt page. Every time you install one of those things, you're giving the people that made it (which isn't always the Facebook staff) the right to take the data from your profile. And from your friends' profiles, too.<br /><br />So, in Facebook, go to the top right of the page and open the "Account" menu next to "Home" and "Profile". Go down and click "Application Settings". This will take you to a page where the apps you have installed are listed. For all the silly Facebook quizzes and stuff you did last year, and don't need anymore, click the "X" to remove the app from your account.<br /><br />This is something that I do every couple of months or so. Rest assured, I don't think any harm will befall you if you choose not to bother doing this. But people seem to be particularly concerned about the privacy issues that are surrounding Facebook and the company's use of our personal information. This is one tiny thing you can do.

        I bought a couple of Audiobooks recently for the long car drive back from Tucson. The first one I bought was a book called <em>Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</em> by Tom Vanderbilt, which is a fascinating book written by a computer scientist about human psychology on the road. (It is, incidentally, the perfect book to listen to in the car while you're driving.) The other book was Malcolm Gladwell's <em>What the Dog Saw</em>. <br /><br />Now, Malcolm Gladwell doesn't have the best voice on the planet, but it's distinctive and generally very pleasant, and I was happy to see that he reads the entire book himself in the recording. On the other hand, the <em>Traffic</em> was not read by its author, but instead by a voice actor.<br /><br />I'm confused by this. If you're an author looking to brand yourself, to make people interested in hiring you for speaking engagements (Malcolm does a lot of those), why wouldn't you want your audience to hear you read your own words yourself? Call it personal branding. As an author, I would think you'd want to build a relationship with your readers, and what better way to do that than to talk directly to them?<br /><br />P.S. The <em>Traffic</em> audiobook is also abridged, while <em>What the Dog Saw</em> is read in its entirety. It also confuses me why they abridge audiobooks. They're much expensive than they should be anyway, and what message are they sending by selling a version with a bunch of material cut out? Doesn't that send the message that the unabridged version was superfluous in the first place?

        Yesterday was my birthday. (Thanks to all of you Facebook peeps that posted on my wall.) It seems like people my age (late twenties, early thirties), more and more, use their birthdays not as an excuse to go out and party, but instead to reflect on how far (or not far) they've gone in life up to this point. People seem to be less in favor of enjoying the current moment, and more in favor of waxing philosophical about finding their purpose and following through on it.<br /><br />My girlfriend is fond of doing this. Each year, on her birthday, she expresses anxiety about not making enough of an impact on the world, or having accomplished enough. We all do it. It's natural. Contentment isn't in our DNA. Instead, we have an innate drive to venture out from our respective caves and kill a Woolly Mammoth for food. <br /><br />If you're chewing on this sense of dissatisfaction the next time you're presented with a birthday cake full of candles you're supposed to blow out by a bunch of tone deaf family members (or office workers) singing to you, then here's my advice: adopt more risk. It's the only way to break the cycle of birthdays where you feel like you didn't do enough during the year. Do things to make yourself uncomfortable. Do what you've always wanted but were too freaked out about. <br /><br />Even our ancestors had to face the risk that they might get stepped on while hunting Mammoths; they needed food. And by the same token: you need life experiences. Or maybe something else. Whatever it is, you won't find it by sitting still. <br /><br />Safe is the new risky.
