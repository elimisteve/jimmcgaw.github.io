                      Waiting isn't always the hardest part. Most of us spend our entire lives waiting for people to give us things. We email the resume, then wait for the right person to find it and offer us a dream job.Usually, waiting is the easiest thing we can do. Waiting for a recruiter to call us is easier than calling companies on the phone. Waiting for the casting director to call us back so we can land...

                      There's a warning before a lot of DVDs start to play. You've probably seen it hundreds of times, and ignore it along with the piracy warning:"The views expressed in this DVD's commentary reflect those of the individuals expressing them, and not those of Twentieth Century Fox or its subsidiaries."What does this imply? It says that the production or distribution company (in this case, Twentieth Century Fox) is keeping the film and its makers at arms...

                      Mark Zuckerberg tells the developers at Facebook that they should work fast. He was quoted as instructing his developers, "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough."If you're not a developer, it might not make sense. Or it may sound like the Facebook CEO is a slave driver. He's not. To me, the intent of his statement is clear, and the idea resonates with me. Part of...

                      Wired magazine wrote an article this month about making the results of the blood tests from our doctors less cryptic, by add visualization charts, graphics, and color coding.Only one question remains after reading this article: why on earth did it take so long for someone to do this?The last time I got my blood results, the doctor had scrawled some notes next to the results. A check mark for each item that was normal, and...

                      Okay...before you'll commit to something, you want to make sure that you're going to get some money for your trouble, right?Writers need advances, because they need beer, and because it puts them on the hook to finish the work they started. It's a publisher saying, "Hey, we believe in you, your work, and we want to take a chance with you." Part of the reason that author royalties (for new writers) are such a small...

                      I was brainstorming recently about how to create a gift idea engine for people trying to determine what to get their friends and relatives for Christmas. After a bit of Googling, I found Amazon's Facebook app, which generates gift recommendations for each of your friends on Facebook based on their profile info.Less than two weeks to go, I thought I'd share the link. Find it here...in the column at the far right, there's a button...

                      Just over nine years ago, when I was going to Michigan State, the university hosted an ice hockey game between themselves and their biggest rival, the University of Michigan. Instead of hosting it inside of the ice arena, but instead converted their football field into an ice arena and held the game there. As a result, they set the world record for attendance at a hockey game. (The game was called the "Cold War" and...

                      If we subscribe to the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, there are five stages to learning and mastering any given skill or profession:1. Novice2. Advanced beginner3. Competent4. Proficient5. ExpertNovices follow rules which have been established for them. When the nuclear reactor starts flashing its "meltdown warning light", for example, they quickly reach for the manual and look for instructions. As they progress up the chain to become experts, intuition gradually supplants obedience.Expertise is difficult to...

                      In writing entries on here, there have been times when I spent 30 minutes writing, refining, and editing a single article that I thought would offer my readers insight, and would get them talking to me. Often, when I do that, I hear nothing. Other times, I'm up at 2 in the morning, sleep deprived, and I'll pound out an entry in a few minutes based on a fleeting thought. And surprisingly, there have been...

                      I have a friend who has worked at Starbucks for quite a few years now. He tells me that the people who come in and order the coffee every morning often have egos that swallowed Cleveland, and treat him less than equitably.It's possible that my friend has worked there a little bit too long, but he does have a point.
