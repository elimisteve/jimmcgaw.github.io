        There's a warning before a lot of DVDs start to play. You've probably seen it hundreds of times, and ignore it along with the piracy warning:<br /><br />"The views expressed in this DVD's commentary reflect those of the individuals expressing them, and not those of Twentieth Century Fox or its subsidiaries."<br /><br />What does this imply? It says that the production or distribution company (in this case, Twentieth Century Fox) is keeping the film and its makers at arms length. It says, "We could care less about this movie, but it sounded profitable on paper, so we made it and hoped that people would pay for it."<br /><br />It makes production companies sound like moneymen. Yes, I know that's what they're supposed to be, but it's disconcerting that they seem to care so little about what they're making, so long as it makes money. It's like an asset manager choosing stocks and saying, "Look, if the CEO says something offensive in the company's biennial statement, it's not my fault."<br /><br />He's right; it's not his fault. Most of us know that. But a few people will hear something offensive in the commentary on a DVD, and they'll be offended enough to get angry at the studio that produced the film. The warning on the DVD won't prevent that from happening.<br /><br />What it does offer is deniability. When the attorney wield their billable hours, it offers a place to hide. And deep down, I know why the warning is there: their lawyers made 'em do it. If the assistant director says something in the commentary that could be construed as anti-Semitic, for example, well, that could result in a lawsuit. I get it.<br /><br />But when people talk about "evil corporations", they're alluding to the "Don't blame me" mentality, and the tendency of larger organizations to shoulder off responsibility when they lose control of what their employees are doing in the trenches. That's not just the case with movie studios, but with any large company that's grown past it ability to manage its own workforce.<br /><br />A large part of what instills trust, and what makes people like you, is the ability on your part to accept some blame. If you're a company, that's part of what we pay you for.

        Mark Zuckerberg tells the developers at Facebook that they should work fast. He was quoted as instructing his developers, "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough."<br /><br />If you're not a developer, it might not make sense. Or it may sound like the Facebook CEO is a slave driver. He's not. To me, the intent of his statement is clear, and the idea resonates with me. Part of it is that if you give people permission and the space to fail or make mistakes, they can do great things. <br /><br />But it's more about going to the edge. There's a time and place to be methodical; to move slowly; to make sure you know 100% of what you need to before you get started; not to ruffle any feathers; to ask for permission; to do what you know works, and nothing more; to act on certainty, but not on hunches; to walk, instead of run; to wait patiently, instead of gunning it.<br /><br />There's a time and place for those things. Innovation happens somewhere else.

      <p class="post-meta">

      <div class="content">
        Wired magazine wrote an <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/11/ff_bloodwork/all/1">article this month</a> about making the results of the blood tests from our doctors less cryptic, by add visualization charts, graphics, and color coding.<br /><br />Only one question remains after reading this article: why on earth did it take so long for someone to do this?<br /><br />The last time I got my blood results, the doctor had scrawled some notes next to the results. A check mark for each item that was normal, and a quick note next to blood sugar: "A little high."<br /><br />What, exactly, does "a little high" mean? After reading it, I had to go online and do some digging. How high is too high when we're talking about blood sugar? What am I at risk for? How at risk am I? And so on.<br /><br />Eventually, after enough Googling, I figured out where I stood in the blood sugar spectrum. I did it by parsing information from a number of publicly available sources, but it was nothing that couldn't have been presented to me in the form of a simple bar chart with a green section ("safe"), yellow section ("warning"), or red section ("problem!"). <br /><br />I think that whenever we (as patients) are given data that's meant to be taken seriously, experienced doctors in high positions resist any innovation that makes analyzing the data more accessible. They resist changing the text-heavy data format to the colorful chart format. This resistance is based on fear, and it's the fear that the more presentable data is to people, the less apt they are to take it seriously.<br /><br />It's the teacher who won't let students laugh in her classroom, because if they're laughing, they're not focused and learning the material.<br /><br />I might be wrong about this, but it's not a stretch to imagine a doctor not wanting his patient's blood work to look like something colorful from a Dr. Seuss book, for fear that the patient might miss the gravity of the results. If a patient has to Google to figure things out, at least they're engaged in the diagnosis a little bit, and maybe that leads to increased compliance.<br /><br />Or it might just be that to your average doctor, blood results don't appear to be broken, and so they don't seem to need any fixing.<br /><br />I don't really think they're broken, but that's not to say they couldn't benefit from a designer's touch. Good design engages. It draws the eye in, and makes the viewer want to keep looking at the content. The more important the information, the more critical the design process should be in planning the delivery of the information.<br /><br />My guess: the Wired article will result in some debate among doctors and medical practitioners, which will lead to a study testing the effects of delivering visualized results versus standard ones. The results of this comparison study will be inconclusive or "statistically insignificant" or some such nonsense, and with no apparent benefit to doctors or patients, the results will stay the way they are.<br /><br />Let's hope I'm wrong. In the meantime, it can never hurt to figure out how to start creating visualizations where you work. A picture of a thousand data points is worth more than the data it represents...so long as it's easy on the eyes.

        Okay...before you'll commit to something, you want to make sure that you're going to get some money for your trouble, right?<br /><br />Writers need advances, because they need beer, and because it puts them on the hook to finish the work they started. It's a publisher saying, "Hey, we believe in you, your work, and we want to take a chance with you." Part of the reason that author royalties (for new writers) are such a small portion of the income earned is because the publisher is adopting all of the risk. <br /><br />But the publisher brings more than venture capital to the table...they also bring validation. They make the author feel there's more of a chance their work will be rewarded. Without that step, why bother?<br /><br />If you're using money as an excuse not to make something, here's some bad news: there's a site called <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>. If you go on Kickstarter, you can create a project (it can be a book, film, or art project, or a product idea) and ask people to fund you. You set a monetary goal, as a sum total you need to raise to make the project happen (say, $12,000), and then you let people pledge different amounts, in $5, $10, or $20 increments. If you don't raise the entire amount, the project is canceled and no money changes hands. But if you reach (or surpass) your goal, you get the money and you get to go ahead with your project.<br /><br />People pledge money on here to projects they like or believe in. In a lot of cases, authors or artists go on here and say, "Here's my idea for a book or album we want to write. If you buy it now, I'll create it and send you a copy when it's done."<br /><br />Pledgers are, in a sense, pre-ordering what they want. Whereas in the past, the role of the publisher or record company was to make educated guesses about what people would buy, this site lets artists go right to their intended audience and ask them, directly, if they would like their idea enough to buy it. And each member of the audience gets to put their money where their mouth is (or not).<br /><br />This doesn't make it easy, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier than it used to be. Now that you know about it, what are you going to start?

        I was brainstorming recently about how to create a gift idea engine for people trying to determine what to get their friends and relatives for Christmas. After a bit of Googling, I found Amazon's Facebook app, which generates gift recommendations for each of your friends on Facebook based on their profile info.<br /><br />Less than two weeks to go, I thought I'd share the link. Find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore">here</a>...in the column at the far right, there's a button that reads "Tap into Your Facebook Network". Click that to get started.<br /><br />You probably shouldn't use it to shop for your girlfriend, but for those distant relatives, it might spit out some useful ideas.

        Just over nine years ago, when I was going to Michigan State, the university hosted an ice hockey game between themselves and their biggest rival, the University of Michigan. Instead of hosting it inside of the ice arena, but instead converted their football field into an ice arena and held the game there. As a result, they set the world record for attendance at a hockey game. (The game was called the "Cold War" and about 74,000 people attended.)<br /><br />The record was broken last May in Germany, but the University of Michigan has probably been planning to top Michigan State since the ice melted nine years ago. Today, a game is being held at U of M's "Big House" stadium, and attendance is supposed to break the record at over 100,000 people.<br /><br />This isn't specific to the University of Michigan, but it's typical of organizations: they don't know what to do, or how big to do it, unless they're doing it relative to a competitor.

        If we subscribe to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a>, there are five stages to learning and mastering any given skill or profession:<br /><br />1. Novice<br />2. Advanced beginner<br />3. Competent<br />4. Proficient<br />5. Expert<br /><br />Novices follow rules which have been established for them. When the nuclear reactor starts flashing its "meltdown warning light", for example, they quickly reach for the manual and look for instructions. As they progress up the chain to become experts, intuition gradually supplants obedience.<br /><br />Expertise is difficult to articulate, but they asked some very experienced, expert airline pilots to write down instructions intended to be read by novice pilots. Then they asked the expert pilots to follow their own instructions. The result? The performance of the expert pilots was hampered by having to follow rules...even though they had written the rules themselves.<br /><br />In most situations, there probably should be a manual, but if you ask a veteran of any trade or profession to follow instructions, you hinder them from being able to do their job well, and they'll be so miserable they'll leave.

        In writing entries on here, there have been times when I spent 30 minutes writing, refining, and editing a single article that I thought would offer my readers insight, and would get them talking to me. Often, when I do that, I hear nothing. <br /><br />Other times, I'm up at 2 in the morning, sleep deprived, and I'll pound out an entry in a few minutes based on a fleeting thought. And surprisingly, there have been times when those quick scribblings have gotten a positive reaction from readers.<br /><br />The truth is, we're generally very bad at separating our own wheat from our chaff. We ignore bad ideas for fear that they won't be well-received and focus on good ones in the hopes they'll be revered. We guess, and we use our best judgment, but too often, we guess wrong.<br /><br />If you have three ideas for novels, three songs you'd like to write, or three paintings you want to paint, don't pick the best one and spend a lot of time refining it. Do all three. Release them into the wild, and let the market pick the best one.

        I have a friend who has worked at Starbucks for quite a few years now. He tells me that the people who come in and order the coffee every morning often have egos that swallowed Cleveland, and treat him less than equitably.<br /><br />It's possible that my friend has worked there a little bit too long, but he does have a point. Any marketing or branding expert in the country (hell, the world) will tell you that Starbucks does more than sell coffee. They sell esteem in a cup. People pay 80 cents to cover the parts, labor, and overhead that goes into the drink and an extra $3.20 to feel good about themselves and what they're drinking in the morning.<br /><br />The power of any major brand lies in the esteem value it offers. The problem with mass marketing and selling this kind of intangible is that over time, it breeds entitlement. And the entitlement mentality is certainly not a healthy way to go through life, and it's less apt to make you popular in social circles.<br /><br />Starbucks or any other super-brand can hardly be blamed for this, but I work very hard to make sure that I don't slip into the entitlement mindset. It's easy to do, and it's a comfortably slippery slope, but I prefer to remind myself that what I have, I have because of others.

        If you attend a craft fair in Southern California, sooner or later, you'll come across someone who's selling rocks.<br /><br />But, these are no ordinary rocks. They're <a href="http://crystal-cure.com/gem-healing.html">healing crystals</a>. Drinkers should grab a peridot for their livers, people with the flu just need some turquoise, and rose quartz is the new age equivalent of Viagra. (Funny, I've never gotten a spam email about rose quartz.)<br /><br />They're not just selling gemstones...they're selling small slices of mythology. Polished or not, people won't just buy a rock, but they will buy a story about how a rock will cure what ails them.<br /><br />People aren't really interested in buying Vitamin C pills, either.
