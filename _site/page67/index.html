        I'm not a very sentimental person. I'm definitely not sentimental about things. My parents were ferocious packrats, and so now, they have a large house that is filled to the hilt with stuff that they will probably never use, but because they might one day need it, it's better to be safe and hang onto it. In some way, packrats like my parents keep stuff around as a means of remembering past events. It's kind of like a physical method of Loci for your past: keep an assortment of old things, each of which reminds you of something in your past. Of course, you can attach any memory to just about anything, no matter how trivial. You might even end up keeping something for the mere memory of when you <em>bought it</em>. Isn't that special?<br/><br/>If I have something around, and I haven't used it in six months, I get rid of it. Life's too short to spend lots of time accumulating stuff that ends up in the dark corners of where you're living, so you can pull it out once a year and reflect on days past. Some people I know even took some of their excess stuff and put it into a storage unit; I think that's a little silly.<br/><br/>And you don't have to hold on to every single book that you've ever read. Seriously. I keep a large number of computer books around long-term, to use as references, but any other books that don't serve me in my day job are another story altogether. I love <em>Breakfast of Champions</em>, but I've long since gotten rid of the first copy I've ever read. Over the course of the past ten years, I've acquired about six copies of that book to read, and instead of keeping it, I give it away to someone else after I'm done each time. What are you hanging on to all those books for?<br/><br/>Before moving out to California, I gave my parents a few boxes of stuff to hang onto, since we couldn't fit all of our stuff in the car for the drive from Michigan to California. Now, I can't remember what was in those boxes. That probably means that, when I return home next, it'll be safe to throw them out. I doubt that I'll miss what I can't recall.

        Back in April, while driving the long stretch of lonesome road between Phoenix and Tucson, AZ, I started to think about the homeless problem in Santa Barbara. From what I've been told, there was a mental hospital here that closed down a few years ago, and when it finally shut its doors, they just released all of its inhabitants without anywhere else to go. This brilliant idea resulted in the fallout you would expect: there are now lots of homeless people roaming the streets begging for change, sleeping on city benches and in parks. This also happened a while back in Ann Arbor, MI, with the same result.<br/><br/>More recently, the city of Santa Barbara was discussing enacting an ordinance that prohibited sleeping in public places. Offenders could be ticketed and possibly jailed. To the city of Santa Barbara: what is wrong with you? Unless they're disturbing the peace or something, leave these people the fuck alone. Police officers in this city have enough to contend with already, what with the gangs down on Haley St stabbing each other every chance they get.<br/><br/>I don't often give to homeless people when they beg for change, not because I subscribe to some bullshit like "social Darwinism", but rather, because of simple economics. Usually, there are lots of homeless people just asking for change. But among them, there is a small handful that are playing instruments like guitar, and they've got a hat out. They're actually providing a service for me, in exchange for any compensation I might like to offer. I sometimes give money to these people.<br/><br/>I once had a homeless guy offer to sell me a little toy monkey for "42 cents" (the price he quoted me). I liked this offer in the entrepreneurial spirit. Obviously, he had just picked it out of the trash, but I gave him a dollar for it. It's sitting on my patio at home right now.<br/><br/>Whenever anyone asks me for the leftovers I'm carrying home from a restaurant, I always give it to them. Anyone desperate enough to eat my leftovers can have them.<br/><br/>Anyway, where was I...ah, yes, so, while driving through Arizona, I started thinking about this problem. One of the issues that comes up when giving money to homeless people is that you don't end up with any control over what they do with it. You give them five bucks, and they might end up buying a half-pint of booze with it, which is a short-term fix for their day, but doesn't really help their situation. I'm sure not all homeless people are doing this, but as a person walking down the street, I can't differentiate between those that are really trying to get some help and those who want to buy drugs and alcohol.<br/><br/>That's a problem. Really, the best thing to do would be to give any money to a charity designed to offer help to the homeless people. They can pool the money they get from everyone and spend it more efficiently, thereby helping many more people with it. They can stretch their resources farther than each homeless person can on their own. And they'll make sure it goes to really helping them.<br/><br/>The problem with this idea, though, is convenience. In order to donate to a charity, I'd have to go home, look up a charity, spend time trying to find one that's really legit, possibly consider more than one, and then finally find a way to give them my money. It's a big hassle. Just giving a dollar to someone while walking down the street, which is a part of my daily routine, is much easier, because I'm not going out of my way. The other big problem is that a lot of people walking main street in Santa Barbara are tourists...I've seen lots of them give to the homeless, but they're not going to go back home concerned enough to actually donate to worthy causes.<br/><br/>I came up with a solution: put parking meters all along the sidewalks of the main street of Santa Barbara. For theatricality, I decided that we should dress up the parking meters to actually look like homeless people. You label the meters themselves with the name of the charity (the name I came up with was "Change for Charity", with the optional tacky slogan: "A Charity for Change"), a URL to a website, and a brief description of the mission: to take change from people and make sure that it ends up helping the homeless.<br/><br/>This way, if people want to donate change, they can do it at their convenience. The other benefit is that parking meters are secure. Any other means of donation would just invite homeless people to steal from them.<br/><br/>Recently, I read in a local Santa Barbara newspaper that the city is trying to do something about this problem, and they're looking for a way to get donations from people, but they haven't yet determined how to take donations in a secure way. I'm interested to see what they come up with.

        When I was home visiting Michigan back in August, I read something in the newspaper about the large number of cherries in the north. There was such a surplus that many farmers were required to let them rot instead of taking them to market to sell. This is an economic problem. If there's too many cherries in the market, the price for them goes down, and when that happens, none of the cherry farmers make any money, so nobody grows any cherries the next year. The quantity produced next year depends on the expected price, so in order to regulate the price, quantities available now are regulated.<br/><br/>Considering the food shortages in other parts of the world, this sounds crazy...letting an abundance of food just spoil and rot, unconsumed, while other goes hungry. If we need to get rid of the food, and other people other places in the world need it, then putting it to good use is a problem of logistics. Here's an idea for a charity: coordinate the transport of the surpluses of food away from the markets in the United States and give it to those who need it elsewhere.<br/><br/>This couldn't be done profitably, and it's probably a whole lot cheaper to buy food for people starving in other countries from sources located closer to those people, but c'mon, there has to be a better way to deal with too much food than just dumping it on the side of the road for the flies.

        I remember in one episode of <em>The Office</em> when it was "pretzel day", the one day of the year the building property manager brings in a pretzel cart to hand out free pretzels to the tenants of the building. After the announcement that the cart has arrived and is now serving pretzels, Steve Carrell, barely containing his excitement, strolls casually down the lobby to get his pretzel only to find there is a huge line to wait in.<br/><br/>So, after waiting patiently, this little pretzel cart vendor asks him what kind of toppings he wants on his pretzel. When Carrell's character asks what his options are, the pretzel man pours forth about thirty different options. As he's spewing them out, the excited smile slowly drains away from Carrell's face, as he realizes in dismay that he can't possibly decide what topping he wants. "Is there any way you can, uh, do all of them?" he asks cautiously.<br/><br/>"'The Works'? Sure," the vendor says, and immediately starts preparing his pretzel which is covered in about thirty different condiments that no sane person would ever put together. Relief rushes into Carrell's face. His pretzel is on its way, and he didn't have to decide. <br/><br/>I've been there before. Being offered lots of choices is not liberating...it's depressing. I remember back in Michigan we had a store called Meijer, which I have to to admit I miss a great deal. Yes, I live someplace with a beach and nice weather 98% of the time, but every time I'm slogging through the aisles of K-Mart, trying to find some nice thing amidst their hoards of useless and overpriced junk, I find myself missing the convenience of Meijer. If you're in the Midwest and you live close to one of them, count yourself lucky you have that as an option.<br/><br/>Meijer had a huge isle full of liquor, and I remember running down the isle, stocking up on booze for a party I was having at my apartment, and I was tossing bottles into my cart much the same way that Nicolas Cage did in the opening scene of the movie <em>Leaving Las Vegas</em>. On one side of the isle, there was booze, and the other side: snack chips. My girlfriend mentioned that we needed to get some potato chips or something to have on hand for the party, and so I turned around to face the wall of snack foods opposite the wall of liquor.<br/><br/>Immediately I felt overwhelmed, just at the sight of all of them. There was just an astonishing number of types of chips. Tortilla chips, in many different shapes, some with lime, some with spice. Doritos. Sun Chips. An entire massive wall of air-filled bags containing junk food. Bags came in different sizes, different weights, and they were all different prices. I didn't even know where to start looking.<br/><br/>And it's not even a matter of deciding upon the brand of chip. Even if you narrow it down and decide that you're going to simply buy Doritos, there are at least a dozen different kinds of Doritos peppering the wall of snack food at Meijer. And then you're faced with a tricky decision: do I go with the original flavor, which is probably a safe bet, or do I take a risk and get something more exciting, like the Cool Ranch Spice. If I'm conservative and go with original, then I'll always wonder if I was missing out. If I try a new kind, I might end up with a bag of chips that nobody really likes.<br/><br/>This prospect might sound kind of silly, because they're just <em>snack chips</em>, for God's sake. Don't we have better things to do than worry about the subtleties of our own unhappiness as <em>consumers</em>?  I would hope so...but the implications of this reach beyond the retail world. Take politics: why are there only two major political parties and not, say, a dozen, each with roughly an equal portion of citizen mindshare? Because it's easy for the average person to pit two parties against one another and compare them. It's <em>one</em> line you need to draw in the sand, so to speak. With 12 separate parties, you need to make 66 unique comparisons to compare each party with the other 11, and 66 requires a lot of time to spend trying to make a decision. That's overwhelming. With that complicated of a political system, you'd better believe I'd be partaking in some anarchy just to stay <em>sane</em>.<br/><br/>The formula for the number of unique comparisons, given <em>x</em> number of choices, is: x * (x-1) / 2. Let's imagine you go into a coffee shop to get a cup of tea, and there are 20 teas to choose from. About 9 of them are green tea, and you can't stand green tea, so you can eliminate those. That leaves you with 11 choices, and 55 comparisons you need to consider. Which one is better than all the others? Your brain will likely be overwhelmed at the prospect, and you'll just grab the first one that sounds good. But was it really the best choice... (?)<br/><br/>From a psychological standpoint, we're not made happy by more choices. On the contrary: more choices make us miserable. And as a very indirect means of arguing my point, I'm going to plug this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696/">The Paradox of Choice: Why Less is More</a>. The author elaborates on how more choices cause us mental misery, and sums up why I detest going to the grocery store these days.

        There is a mistake that I have made at several times during my life, and even now that I'm aware of it, I still fall into the trap of making it sometimes. The mistake to which I'm prone is assuming that <em>life is easier for other people than it is for me</em>.<br/><br/>This has implications in my actions. During high school, a time I spent immersed in a weird combination of self-absorption and self-loathing, I often found myself frustrated by other people. This was largely because I didn't understand them. I was afraid that people would realize just how ignorant I was of a lot of things, and more importantly, I was afraid people would recognize that I was afraid. During a lot of social interactions, I was terrified that people were constantly judging me.<br/><br/>This is based on a few flawed assumptions, the first being that all of the people I went to high school were never afraid of anything themselves. I believed that everyone else had their ducks in a row, that they had their lives together and their problems worked out, and so I came to expect a lot of people. I expected them to accommodate me, since I was the poor suffering person and they were brimming with confidence and self-assurance. This expectation was, of course, unreasonable, and I think it made me come across as an asshole.<br/><br/>And, of course, in a normal situation, not everyone in the room is ever sitting there silently judging <em>you</em>. That's a very egocentric viewpoint, and causes a weird feedback loop inside a person's head. There are some judgemental people in the world, and it takes time to learn to deal with them, but I wouldn't worry about their opinions too much.<br/><br/>Today, the situation is different for me, as I understand that we're all afraid at times. I've found that the best way to deal with other people, and to deal with <em>myself</em> dealing with other people, I just have to keep reminding myself that others are doing what they do because they're trying to deal with their own fears and shortcomings. Life is a hard thing to get through, and without any specific instruction, we're all just kind of winging it.<br/><br/>In short, whatever people around me are doing, if it annoys me, if it seems arrogant, if it a person comes across as being really angry, I try to remind myself that they are <em>coping</em>. This is what all of us are doing, really: coping. We find little things that get us through our days, little things that bring us joy, and cling to them like crazy. <br/><br/>People choose a religion, political viewpoints, and an affinity for a certain type of music because it helps them cope. If someone disagrees with you about something like this, let them be. Turn the other cheek. They're coping. Unless, of course, you feel the need to argue because that's how you yourself like to cope with things.<br/><br/>Of course, saying that people are always coping implies that life always sucks. It doesn't. I don't really subscribe to that whole "being is suffering" maxim put forth by the existentialists, at least not in the modern-day United States. People have times when they're happy and times when they're not so happy. They try to keep the good times rolling and cope with the bad when they come up. <br/><br/>We're all trying to make the best of a bad situation. It helps to remember that whenever you're dealing with anyone, especially a difficult person.

        Seeing some old pictures online of the house where I lived in college for my senior year got me thinking about the people that I used to live with. I'm friends with many of them on Facebook, but in that context, they're all just people that I once knew at some point in the past. It's rare that I actually reflect on the days when we were all living together, and think back to the daily interactions that I used to have with almost twenty people who were initially strangers but who gradually, via those interactions, became friends and acquaintances. Now they've joined the ranks of my friends on Facebook, where the people from my past have all been smooshed into one aggregated blob of people. Online, it's easy to forget the origins of each one.<br/><br/>But yesterday, someone posted some pictures of this old college house and a few people sitting around dying Easter eggs, and this got me really thinking about the days when I lived there, five years ago. Back then, I was a very different person (in some ways, maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part), so remembering my experiences with these people is as good a means as any for me to get some perspective, and to reflect on what I've learned.<br/><br/>One general lesson that I took from these reflections: we all have our blind spots. Our brains have this neat way of tricking us into thinking that we've got the whole picture, and that we aren't missing any details. But we're always missing something, whether by pure blind denial or selective perception. We choose to ignore our own motives that are less than noble, and ignore the consequences of our actions when they turn out badly. And it's very easy to notice the shortcomings of others while ignoring our own.<br/><br/>Ten years ago I wrote a poem (one of six I've written in my life, and, like most poems, all six were terrible) that had candles as characters. They were given sight by having their wicks lit by their owner. The flame on top of their cylindrical wax bodies acted as their one eye to the world. I ended the poem with the observation that a light source cannot see the shadows it casts, but that it <em>can</em> see the shadows of others, and likened this to our own perception of ourselves. So it goes.<br/><br/>This leaves me continually wondering: what am I missing about myself right now? Maybe time will tell.

        My girlfriend's parents have been spending the past winter building a new house in Ann Arbor, MI, and I finally got to go home and see the results this past weekend. The house is very, very well designed. It's a timber frame house, but I'm not referring to the architecture when I say that the design is good. I'm referring more to the little things that make living (or visiting) the place much more enjoyable in ways that most people probably are not aware of.<br/><br/>As one example, all of the doorknobs in the house are the type that you have to push down on (the so-called "lever handles") instead of the typical "grab and twist". It was one of the first things I noticed, and I immediately knew why: the squeezing and twisting motion required to open usual doorknobs wreaks havoc on arthritic hands or those with other afflictions or injuries. My girlfriend's mom and step-dad actually took the time to think this through, and they decided to use lever handles for all of the doors in their house.<br/><br/>Now, my girlfriend's parents are not old. They have no trouble using regular doorknobs. But they understand that they will not be the only ones using them, that one day they will grow old and may require the ease of these doorknobs, and that if they ever choose to sell their house, little things like this might command a premium for the cost of the house by a buyer who is mindful of these kinds of issues. (attention real estate developers...hint! hint!)<br/><br/>We're all dimly aware of the eventual journey we need to make to visit the "spirit in they sky", and while this fact gets a lot of press (and radio play), there is a lesser-discussed long road a lot of us will have to travel before we get to that point: old age. It makes sense to try and create a world where we won't be left behind. And for those of us that are not handicapped or disabled, we have been lucky...but that luck could change any day now. Accessibility should be something everyone considers when they're creating something for use by others, no matter what it is. As the elderly population grows and the demand for these kinds of things rises, the economic benefits of these choices will become clearer.

        When I was about halfway through high school, I became convinced that all high school teachers were idiots. I suppose there was some mindless teenage rebellion in it, but it was based on my experience with the public education system. Now, I went to a good high school. A very good high school. Most high schools would be lucky to be half as good as mine was. In hindsight, I'm very glad that my parents knew where to purchase real estate because my high school education has ended up working out well for me.<br/><br/>The problem was with the method by which we were taught certain subjects. English is the perfect example; I spent lots of time being made to read novels which never had, don't have, and never will have any bearing on my existence as a person. They're not relevant to my experience as a human being. I never had any problem learning and memorizing vocabulary words, because I always found a way to take advantage of those, and put them to good use in my writing. But reading some New York Times bestseller like <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> or <em>Cold Sassy Tree</em> (no, I'm not going to link to them, they're both terrible) is not helping me grow as a person.<br/><br/>Now, of the better English teachers I've had, the really good ones have made some attempt to explain <em>why</em> we're reading the books we are. They try to convey the significance of them. They explain the logic behind why some of that garbage is on recommended reading lists in public schools.<br/><br/>This helped, but wasn't quite enough. Take a work of literature like Dante's <em>Inferno</em>. It mattered back when Dante wrote it, and stirred up quite a bit of controversy. But without learning history first, you cannot appreciate the work to its full extent. Yeah, you can read it, and as long as you've read the Bible, you  can get some of the satire, but without understanding Dante's motives, or what was happening in the world at the time he composed it, leaves a lot to be desired. It's like making kids 100 years from now watch episodes of "Family Guy". A lot of the jokes are cultural and would be lost on anyone 100 years from now, and more than half of the gags are based on pop culture of the 80s and 90s, which is sure to have been evicted from the average person's general knowledge a century later.<br/><br/>Learning without comprehension is difficult. Let's imagine that you want to write a report about the life of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. for school. To do so fully, and to understand him as a person, you need to understand what was happening during the Civil Rights movement back during the time that he lived. The significance of his actions is lost and difficult to comprehend if you just focus on <em>what</em> he did, without looking at <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> he did it.<br/><br/>Context is important. And history provides that context. I don't think you can study politics, religion, philosophy, literature, art, music, sociology, or a variety of other subjects without first studying the history associated with them. I'll admit that you can probably study something like calculus and succeed as an engineer without knowing anything about the life of Issac Newton. But for most things, you can't really comprehend anything to the full extent without some context.<br/><br/>Without understanding why, without learning the context, it's just rote learning. You memorize facts, dates, and trivia so you can pass examinations and get good grades. But learning is always easier if you have the context. The best teachers I've had in my life understood this, and not only explained to their students the context of historical events, but also explained why it should matter to us as people. They are able to bridge contexts of the past with the realities of the present. These are the teachers and professors that I still think of to this day, and remember as having made an impact on me as a person.<br/><br/>Perhaps I shouldn't have been so judgmental of my teachers in high school. Oh well. I was a spoiled kid in an overly-affluent suburban area. At the time, I didn't understand my own context in the class structure.

      <div class="content">
        So now it's been about a year since Tara and I have relocated to Santa Barbara. I moved out here to start a new job, which was a hectic time for us, living in a filthy basement infested with spiders, no kitchen. Eventually we found a nice apartment in a great location very close to downtown and main street, and just over a mile from the beach. During the past year, I left the job that I came out here for and started a new one.<br/><br/>While I've written a few entries on here that blab on about my opinions about human psychology and the nature of software development, I'm guessing that very few people reading this really give a flying fig about such matters. People are likely much more interested in hearing me comment, at long last, on the "Jim McGaw Condition". That is, you might be wondering: how are things? How has my life been?<br/><br/>A lot of people have asked me things like, "How's the easy life?" While my first inclination is to mention that I still have to work forty hours a week at a job, still have to pay all the bills that I used to pay, etc., I quickly remember that I just spent the past winter not dealing with any snow. I didn't have to wake up, drag my tired ass out to the car to scrap inches of snow off of it in freezing cold weather, and then drive to a job I really couldn't stand at ten miles an hour while trying to keep my car from sliding into other cars or off the road entirely.<br/><br/>This has been, to say the <em>very</em> least, extremely nice. It was seventy degrees out here, almost all winter, with a few days where it kind of rained. The beach is a mile from us one way, and the mountains are a couple miles from us the other way. It's still very strange waking up in a place where you go out and the mountains are just always right there in plain sight. I spent so long living on the flat plains of Michigan that I relished visiting my family in Tucson, where you were just surrounded by all kinds of different mountains. I still haven't gotten completely used to waking up, walking outside, and just seeing them there all the time. There's something so therapeutic about it.<br/><br/>Santa Barbara itself is gorgeous. I grew up in Troy, Michigan, where there were tons of ludicrous ordinances that were in place to keep people who were really OCD happy. For example, in Troy you weren't allowed to hang a clothesline in your backyard to hang up laundry to dry, simply because <em>someone</em> might not like the sight of it. Your lawn had to be kept up to certain extent, in that you needed grass and it had to be kept cut to a certain minimum height, or else you got fined out the ass. They made some sense, but like most laws, they did little to actually improve the state of anything.<br/><br/>There are ordinances here, too, but they are different, they make sense, and they all work together to make the city of Santa Barbara an absolutely wonderful place to live and visit. It feels much different than any other city you've ever been to. Building architecture has to conform to a certain look and feel, and buildings can only be so many stories tall. While I'm sure that these ordinances bug the living crap out of any developer who's trying to build within the city, I don't care. Screw them and their complaints. The result is a city that has a very small-town feel (even though there are 90,000+ people here), with a bunch of small houses and office buildings that pepper the land from the water up into the mountains, many of them with a distinct "Spanish" feel. Unlike Detroit, there isn't any problem with sprawl here, simply because there's an Ocean to the south and mountains to the north. The city just <em>can't</em> sprawl, no matter how many city council members are "lobbied to" for land-use permits.<br/><br/>I doubt I'll be able to stay here for very much longer. The cost of housing in Santa Barbara is absolutely crazy. We're renting, and that works for right now because we're not eating in our savings, but it would be impossible for me to hold down a normal job and be able to afford a house here. There are lots of people here who bought their houses over ten years ago, back when (and I still can't believe this was ever true) the cost of housing wasn't that outrageous. The cost of houses back in the 90's used to be accessible to working people. Now, the people who bought houses back then on sitting on unrealized capital gains of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Very nice boom for them, but it means that when we're ready to get a bigger place and a dog, we need to either get a condo (yikes) or move outta here. <br/><br/>We've talked about it, and chances are good that we're going to end up back in Ann Arbor. I think that Detroit and I are done for. The only possible reason I might move back to the Detroit area is if my parents one day need me there on an ongoing basis to take care of them for some reason. But I have no interest in returning to that city, simply because it's a generally bad area that's very much in economic decay, and I do NOT see that changing anytime soon. There has been talk of the Michigan economy rebounding as a whole in the next five years. That may happen, but I think Detroit is pretty well screwed for the long haul. There's a ton of old infrastructure there that the tax base can't possibly fix, even if the entire area consolidated and suburban area tax revenue was distributed evenly throughout the area (right, right, my Republican friends are saying that's <em>socialism</em>, which is <em>evil</em>, blah blah...keep in mind I'm being hypothetical and not advocating anything), there's no way that the situation is going to improve without a massive change in the laws and regulations regarding accountability of elected officials and land use planning (a slim possibility), or a change in human nature (no fucking way). In short, the people that can leave will, and those that cannot will continue to have the economic life sucked out of them.<br/><br/>I like Ann Arbor better anyway, even if Pfizer did just take a proverbial dump on the city by moving their business elsewhere. Screw those pill pushers and their tax revenue. Ann Arbor will still come out ahead and I look forward to returning there someday.<br/><br/>That's all I'm going to say for now. As a final note, I'll mention that both of the jobs I've had while I've been out here have been great. Both web development, for the most part, and I've really enjoyed the people and environment of both, even though there are pros and cons of each. Santa Barbara has been very great, despite the occasional gang-related stabbing that happens only a few blocks from us every now and then, and all of you reading this should plan on coming to visit whenever you get the chance.<br/><br/>By the way, I'll be in Michigan the weekend of August 16th. (I think that's the correct date) Mark your calendars.<br/><br/>Cheers!

        Tell me if this has ever happened to you:<br/><br/>You come to a crosswalk at a major intersection where a bunch of people are standing there, staring at the "Don't Walk" orange hand across the street. There's a similar group of people across the street, waiting for the light to change so they can cross to where you are. All of these people seem to be in a daze. You approach the curb and look both ways. Yes, the hand is correct: if you were to cross the street now, you'd be entering a line of traffic that has a green light.<br/><br/>But, there are no cars coming in either direction. You look left, then right, and there aren't any cars in sight. There aren't even any places where cars can turn out of parking lots and enter the line of traffic. Even if you decide to jaywalk now, you'll be across the street by the time any cars that emerge in the distance reach you. And by that time, the light will have probably changed anyway.<br/><br/>So you go for it, carefully stepping out into the street to cross to the other side, just like the chicken in that ancient joke we all laughed at so hard when we were younger. <br/><br/>And a strange thing happens when you do this: suddenly, everyone else starts crossing too. A couple of people might trickle directly after you, and then shortly thereafter the majority of the rest of them swarm right after you. Even the people across the street start crossing towards you, and pretty soon you've got two full street corners of about two or three dozen people all jaywalking across the street with you. Sure, there are a few timid souls that stay back on the curb, waiting for the little white man to show up on the crosswalk sign, so they can cross the street as law-abiding citizens and not commit little civil infractions like the rest of us horrible sinning jaywalkers. What<em>ever</em>.<br/><br/>But what gives? Why was it me deciding to cross against the traffic light that suddenly got everyone up and walking? It was almost as though everyone was sleepwalking, and I came along with an air horn, woke them all up, and yelled, "C'mon, let's go!" <br/><br/>The reason thing kind of thing happens has something to do with a field in psychology called "group dynamics", and this kind of weird phenomenon in human behavior was addressed in the works of a psychologist named W.R. Bion. He was a psychotherapist who worked for several years at a mental hospital, treating patients with psychological disorders. During his time here, he noticed something funny going on: in the course of trying to treat all of the patients, it seemed that they were defeating his attempts at treating them. The patients all seemed to foil his forms of therapy.<br/><br/>It didn't seem like a collective effort. The patients were not getting together when Dr. Bion was in the can and conspiring to thwart his treatments as a group. But the behavior seemed consistent enough from patient to patient that he set out to figure out the answer to the question: <em>are the patients working together or are they just all doing the same thing by coincidence?</em> <br/><br/>The answer Bion arrived at was less than conclusive: it was a little of both. The social dynamics of a group of people is a funny thing. We often suppress our desires out of a need for conformity. Nobody was crossing the street because everyone wanted to be Joe Model Citizen, just like everyone else on that curb, in accordance with the behaviour exhibited by the overall group. But deep down, everyone really wanted to just jaywalk, get across the street, and get on with their day.<br/><br/>You see, we all want to rebel and be individualistic, but we're constrained by a drive to "fit in". So, as soon as I came along and crossed the street, in a gleeful act of defiance, everyone else decided to be defiant with me. It was as though I had given them the permission to rebel. Suddenly, they could follow through on their true desire to cross against the signal. They were suddenly free to be individualistic--just like everyone else!<br/><br/>For the longest time, I was really annoyed with politics, simply because they were so intangible to someone looking for some objectivity. The thing is, the political arena is so complicated that most people don't interact directly with them. Doesn't anyone really sit there and watch those hours and hours of Congress in session on CNN? Anyone? If you're out there, you need to get a job, or a hobby, or a drug habit, <em>anything</em> to be more productive than you're being now.<br/><br/>Most people don't touch politics through politicians. Instead, most of us get the scoop from commentators on television, like news anchors. This tends to be fairly dry and uninteresting. A much more engaging means is from those other political pundits in the media: Bill O'Reilly on TV, Rush Limbaugh on the radio, Al Franken and Ann Coulter via books, Michael Moore through all of the above (god help us), etc. <br/><br/>Now, as an intellectual, rational, <em>thinking</em> person, I'm pretty insulted by most all of them. I can boil down the opinions that I hear spewing from the mouths of these assholes into a quick summary. To paraphrase:<br/><br/>Rush Limbaugh: What Obama is doin' now is fuckin' crazy because he's a Democrat.<br/>Michael Moore: What Bush is doin' now is fuckin' crazy because he's a Republican.<br/><br/>Uh-huh. That's not political commentary. Those are fundamental attribution errors. When you get to the point where you're attacking another person's character instead of addressing their arguments, you've ceased entirely to engage me in what you're saying. It's ad hominem. I want you to tell me exactly <em>why</em> you disagree with the arguments of the other side, and I expect a fair and balanced examination of any issue to have some overlap with the other side, so I want you tell me what parts of the other side make sense to you as well. Democratics and Republicans have some overlap in their base beliefs...let's at least admit that.<br/><br/>First of all, and I know this is going to piss some people off: the political party that a person chooses to align themselves with is not indicative of their ethos. I resent people who make snap judgments about me and the kind of person I am because I make a comment that seems "left" or "right". You're putting a mask over my face. You're being lazy and you're lumping me into this spectrum of bullshit which, in your mind, has only two colors: left and right. No. No no no. That's so wrong on so many levels I'm not even going to go into it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there's a word for this, but I'm an "issue-based" political person. What I think or believe is based on that particular issue, my own intuition, and what little education I might have about that particular issue. I'm not really either a Republican or a Democrat, when you look at it that way. I just <em>am</em>. In all honesty, I think this is the way most people are. Sure, people give themselves a label, but deep down, they're really thinking people that just notice patterns in their own line of thinking, and then gravitate towards other people with that same line of thinking.<br/><br/>I used to wonder why we never got impartial political commentary. Why couldn't there just be somebody who discussed the issues like a human being talking to fellow human beings? It's because people aren't really interested in aligning themselves with their own opinions. It's the confusion about whether people are individualistic or social sheep all over again: they're a little of both. They have their own opinions about political matters. But in public, they call themselves "Republican" or "Democrat", and they gravitate towards the extreme issues. They're trying to differentiate themselves, just like everyone else.<br/><br/>It's weird. I still don't get it.<br/><br/>And it seems that there can only be two sides. Two, and no more. Black and white. This is why the libertarian party, the green party, the leprechauns-with-nunchucks-who-drink-Cutty-Sark party, or whoever else, will never stand a chance getting elected into office at a presidential level. I don't think people can even handle the <em>thought</em> of having to choose between more than two different parties. It's just too many things for the human mind to weigh fairly. It will always be Coke vs Pepsi. Windows vs Unix (aka Macs). Having two choices affords a level of comfort that we, as human beings, have grown accustomed to. It's our zone.<br/><br/>And this is why I've come to accept politics for what they are instead of spouting piss and vinegar about the lack of objectivity. Sure, I'm still going to keep my nose out of things...all I'm saying is that if there's one thing you can't do, it's take a stand against people just for being people, a mistake which a lot of politicians make. And c'mon...most of us are better than that.
