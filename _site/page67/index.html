                      I'm not a very sentimental person. I'm definitely not sentimental about things. My parents were ferocious packrats, and so now, they have a large house that is filled to the hilt with stuff that they will probably never use, but because they might one day need it, it's better to be safe and hang onto it. In some way, packrats like my parents keep stuff around as a means of remembering past events. It's kind...

                      Back in April, while driving the long stretch of lonesome road between Phoenix and Tucson, AZ, I started to think about the homeless problem in Santa Barbara. From what I've been told, there was a mental hospital here that closed down a few years ago, and when it finally shut its doors, they just released all of its inhabitants without anywhere else to go. This brilliant idea resulted in the fallout you would expect: there...

                      When I was home visiting Michigan back in August, I read something in the newspaper about the large number of cherries in the north. There was such a surplus that many farmers were required to let them rot instead of taking them to market to sell. This is an economic problem. If there's too many cherries in the market, the price for them goes down, and when that happens, none of the cherry farmers make...

                      I remember in one episode of <em>The Office</em> when it was "pretzel day", the one day of the year the building property manager brings in a pretzel cart to hand out free pretzels to the tenants of the building. After the announcement that the cart has arrived and is now serving pretzels, Steve Carrell, barely containing his excitement, strolls casually down the lobby to get his pretzel only to find there is a huge line...

                      There is a mistake that I have made at several times during my life, and even now that I'm aware of it, I still fall into the trap of making it sometimes. The mistake to which I'm prone is assuming that <em>life is easier for other people than it is for me</em>.<br/><br/>This has implications in my actions. During high school, a time I spent immersed in a weird combination of self-absorption and self-loathing, I often...

                      Seeing some old pictures online of the house where I lived in college for my senior year got me thinking about the people that I used to live with. I'm friends with many of them on Facebook, but in that context, they're all just people that I once knew at some point in the past. It's rare that I actually reflect on the days when we were all living together, and think back to the...

                      My girlfriend's parents have been spending the past winter building a new house in Ann Arbor, MI, and I finally got to go home and see the results this past weekend. The house is very, very well designed. It's a timber frame house, but I'm not referring to the architecture when I say that the design is good. I'm referring more to the little things that make living (or visiting) the place much more enjoyable...

                      When I was about halfway through high school, I became convinced that all high school teachers were idiots. I suppose there was some mindless teenage rebellion in it, but it was based on my experience with the public education system. Now, I went to a good high school. A very good high school. Most high schools would be lucky to be half as good as mine was. In hindsight, I'm very glad that my parents...
