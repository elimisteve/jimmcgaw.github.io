                      People tend to get really interested when I mention that I know about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Their ears perk up and they start to poke at me with questions in an effort to learn how to get themselves ranked higher on Google.

In trying to explain what the heck is going on, Doc Brown draws a line on a chalkboard. "Think of time as a straight line," he explains.

This is somewhat interesting, because I didn't get stung by a bee until I was in seventh grade...but I was afraid of bees long before that happened. Just the fact that my parents told me about this particular insect, that could stick a needle out of its butt on command and use it to pierce...

                      Being human means being susceptible...to erring, to caffeine addictions, and to doing stupid things in order to impress members of the opposite sex. Judgment sneaks in there, too. We're an opinionated animal, so it's rare for us to sit completely on the fence without falling onto one side of any given debate.<br /><br />This isn't always a bad thing. Judgment is bad not when it's wrong, but when it isn't constructive. Judgment will let you...
