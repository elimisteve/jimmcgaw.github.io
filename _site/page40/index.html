        ...are the ones who are insane enough to think that they can. There will always be people who will say to you, "Don't do that." This is how becoming a little hard of hearing can be a major virtue.<br /><br />Someone once asked Helen Keller if she thought there was anything worse than being blind. She replied, "Yes, there is something worse...it would be to be able to see, but to not have any vision." <br /><br />In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is king. Almost all of us two eyes, but there's an awful lot of things we don't see because we're busy not looking for them.

        People tend to get really interested when I mention that I know about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Their ears perk up and they start to poke at me with questions in an effort to learn how to get themselves ranked higher on Google. And that's great, because I'm thrilled to be surrounded by people and friends who are taking an interest in something that is not only terribly academic but might also help them accomplish something as well.<br /><br />The short answer: it's complicated. The long short answer: it's the number of other sites on the Internet linking to your site and the text that those links contain. The long long answer: instead of me boring you to death, Google "search engine optimization" and you'll find lots of stuff. (Anyone who's ranking high for that probably knows what they're doing.)<br /><br />The answer people don't want to hear: SEO alone probably isn't enough for your average person or business. If you're a lawyer in Miami, and you want to rank highly for "trial law Miami", then I encourage you to go for it, even if there are lots other law firms in Miami trying to rank for that, too. But if you're trying to build a business that's dependent on getting in the first page of results on Google, your plan is probably going to fail.<br /><br />Better idea: brand a word or phrase that doesn't exist yet. Make it gobbledygook if you must, but carve out a block of the English language that's unclaimed and build something around that. And if it's worth finding, rest assured that with enough patience and perseverance, it will be found.

        ...is that he told a story. Ever seen <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>? A lot of the movie is him sharing personal details about his own life, about growing up on a farm, about the values instilled in him from a very young age. This has nothing to do with global warming, so why include it? It's powerful.<br /><br />People can argue back and forth until they're blue in the face about whether or not the facts he presented in his documentary are right or wrong, but ultimately, Al (I can call you "Al", can't I?) won a Nobel Peace prize because of the story that he told. And, whether you love him or hate him, he did manage to change the world.<br /><br />It turns out that culture is an excellent conductor of stories. Stories resonate. Facts, on the other hand, are like files on our computers: we put them into a directory somewhere on our hard drive, and then when we need them, we have to go searching for them, and unless we remember where we put them, in that massive directory structure we created in our E:/ drive, and what the bloody hell we <em>named</em> the file, we won't find it.<br /><br />What you need to be, if you want to change things, is a narrator. There's an interesting book called <em>Tell Me A Story</em>, in which the author argues convincingly that one limitation of artificial intelligence is that it will probably never be able to compose stories. Computers can remember all the facts in the world, but Moore's Law will probably never grant them the ability to compose the kind of fable that Aesop could.<br /><br />Culture is an excellent conductor of stories; turns out that culture in the age of the Internet is a superconductor, on crack.

        In <em>Back to the Future, Part 2</em>, Marty McFly inadvertently alters the course of history and created a dystopian version of the 1985 that he lives in. In trying to explain what the heck is going on, Doc Brown draws a line on a chalkboard. "Think of time as a straight line," he explains. He draws another line that forks off of the main line in the middle and eventually runs parallel with the main one. "At some point in the past, something happened to divert the flow of time, resulting in an alternate version of the 1985 you remember." (I'm quoting here, but that might not be exactly what he said. I'm trying not to get sued.)<br /><br />It looked something like this:<br /><br /><img style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 75px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/THybPDEDJpI/AAAAAAAAANw/BLwaRLAkF78/s400/back_to_the_future.gif" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511450726817277586" /><br /><br />I've met a lot of people who are, in their minds, living in one version of 1985, and spend an awful lot of time wondering what life is like in the <em>other</em> 1985. A few years ago I was talking with a friend of mine, who was lamenting (while drunk) about how much time he had spent drinking in his younger days. He now wondered: if he hadn't drank so much when he was 20, could he have accomplished more?<br /><br />I'd like to point out to the reader: we were both 25 years old at the time.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you're 25, you don't get to look back on your life and wonder where the time went. You don't get to point to past mistakes as having inevitably changed the course of your life to the extent that you're blocked from accomplishing anything. I don't even think you get to act this way to when your 55, or 65. <br /><br />In the chart above, we're all living in 1955. We're <em>at</em> the fork in the road, and the best part is: there are more than two paths. As a matter of fact, there aren't even paths laid out for you already. They might be there in your brain, but that's a matter of perception. You get to draw your own if you want.<br /><br />I met a 46-year-old guy about six months ago who said something similar: "If I hadn't drank for the past 20 years, what could I have done?"<br /><br />Easy to view this kind of attitude as silly, but how much time do you spend worrying about what could have been instead of what could be?

        Think about how Craigslist and its postings worked to replace newspaper ads. Or how Wikipedia and its throes of contributors managed to replace Encyclopedia Britannica as people's main source of browsing new information. Or how Barack Obama managed to raise millions of dollars online by spreading himself through advocates online.<br /><br />How does fundraising work in the age of the Internet? How do non-profits reach the masses and ask them to contribute? How do they reward them for doing it? How is it better than cutting checks and mailing them in? Is making it digital, through the use of Paypal instead of personal checks, enough of an improvement to make it better? <br /><br />I think there's a chasm here, one that a few people have exploited (<a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> has done a great job, for one). But I'm willing to bet that in terms of giving to charity in cyberspace, we're going to look back in ten years and realize that 2010 was just ancient history.<br /><br />That's probably true for a lot of things online, and not just micro-philanthropy.

        All things are never equal, but all things considered, I'd be willing to bet that the lifestyle of the average American of probably better than that of the average American of 100 years ago. You could argue that the difference between the high and low points has stratified to a greater extent, and you might be right, but most people in the United States have it pretty good.<br /><br />And yet, lots of people are miserable. You could blame the media; indeed, there's no shortage of sociologist pointing their fingers at the six o'clock news, citing them as the reason that we're not happy about our good fortune. I blame <em>mass</em> media. It's not journalism per se, but the fact that technology has changed so drastically in the past century. <br /><br />Two hundred years ago, the news you got was local. Bad news is not a 20th century invention; in fact, we probably have less bad news now than any other century in history. But when bad news came, it was local. It was stuff that happened right in your tiny village. This probably meant two things:<br /><br />1. It was infrequent (maybe not in the year 1348)<br />2. Since it was local, you could do something about it.<br /><br />What mass media has given us, through television and Internet, is news from all over the place, every day. And since the news is so fond of "leading with bleeding", there's no shortage of bad news pouring in from all corners of the earth. The frequency has increased, but more importantly, the proximity has decreased, which means that for all the bad things happening elsewhere in the world, not only do you hear all about them, but there's probably nothing you can do to mitigate them. And powerlessness is indeed a contributor to one's unhappiness.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to overestimate the impact technology has had on human beings, particular regarding their psychological well-being. A tough thing to generalize about, but I'm willing to bet people who don't watch the news are, on the average, happier people.<br /><br />I write this shortly after a time when Pakistan was submerged by floods, an event which got remarkably little mass media coverage by my account. If there's a good message to take away from all of that bad stuff in the news, it's this: we all have a lot to be grateful for.

        When I was a kid, I was deathly afraid of bees. Or, more specifically, I was afraid of bee stings. This is somewhat interesting, because I didn't get stung by a bee until I was in seventh grade...but I was afraid of bees long before that happened. Just the fact that my parents told me about this particular insect, that could stick a needle out of its butt on command and use it to pierce my flesh, was enough to make me run in terror whenever one flew near me.<br /><br />I'm not alone in this. I used to know people in college who would get antsy and run to evade a bee if they encountered one outside. And yet these same people had no trouble going home to their dorms and, the same day, proceed to binge drink copious amounts of beer.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet the sting of your typical hangover is far worse and prolonged than the sting of any honeybee. If you're allergic to bee strings, you have a legitimate reason to be afraid, but outside of that, it's pretty irrational behavior. The difference is probably control; as long as you're doing it to yourself, the pain that comes with vomiting up after too much liquor is a choice we make, and so we accept it.<br /><br />That, and the fear lingers. There's some deeply Pavlovian about a fear of bees for a lot of people, and even in adulthood, we never end up unlearning it.

        Being human means being susceptible...to erring, to caffeine addictions, and to doing stupid things in order to impress members of the opposite sex. Judgment sneaks in there, too. We're an opinionated animal, so it's rare for us to sit completely on the fence without falling onto one side of any given debate.<br /><br />This isn't always a bad thing. Judgment is bad not when it's wrong, but when it isn't constructive. Judgment will let you find fault with the actions of the people around you, and will give you endless fodder for complaining endlessly about how things aren't as good as they good be. When it's an excuse to practice avoidance, when we use anger as a way of hiding, then it stops being of any use.<br /><br />And yet, when I ask someone for their opinion, I am asking for their judgment. I'm asking for insight. The more lucid and well thought-out, the better, but I'm not looking for a stale regurgitation of plain facts. I'm looking for the line you're drawing in the sand. <br /><br />You won't please everyone, and you might anger a few people, but it just might be the best way to avoid being outsourced.

        I've dealt with a fair number of salespeople in my time. Some of them come across as being high-pressure and manipulative, while others come across as being reasonable and helpful. What differentiates the two?<br /><br />The question matters, I think, even if you don't happen to work in a company sales department or in retail, because all of us are salespeople at certain points in our lives. When was your last job interview? How well did you sell yourself? And even if you can't bring yourself to admit that you do have to play the role of the seller from time to time in your life, I always tell people they should read a sales book <em>at least</em> as a means of self-defense.<br /><br />I'm also not talking about the times you walk into a store when you intend to buy something, you buy it, and leave. In that case, the salesperson hasn't really done anything; as far as you're concerned, they're just the human equivalent of one of those self-checkout machines they have in grocery stores. But there have been times when I've gone into a store and spent more money than I expected. And it was because the salesperson closed me on spending more. And I left a satisfied and happy customer.<br /><br />But there have also been times when some salesperson tried to coerce me into buying something I really didn't want or need. (The warranties the clerks are peddling on commission at Best Buy come to mind.) This is just plain annoying. But what is the difference?<br /><br />It's not in the tactics. Truth be told, in my experience with salespeople, there's been a lot of overlap of closing techniques between helpful salespeople and annoying ones. One example: the "alternate of choice" close...let the buyer choose between something and something, not something and nothing. ("Did you want to wear that lovely fur coat out or should I wrap it for you...?")<br /><br />But when do these kinds of shenanigans cross a line? When do they start to bother us as shoppers? Pressure is pressure, after all, but on its own, pressure isn't always a bad thing. So what is it that separates the good from the bad?<br /><br />Here's the key: salespeople come across as high-pressure, and not helpful, when they try to close the sale <em>before they've demonstrated the value</em> of what they're selling. If you manage to convince someone that the purchase will actually help them (note: I'm not talking about lying or being deceitful here), then you're okay to start gently nudging the person in the direction you want.<br /><br />You can firmly and politely ask for a raise, but you'd better be sure your boss already thinks you're worth it.

        There are a few very simple lessons that I hope people take away after they read they stuff I've been writing on here, and one of them is: don't take your own ideas that seriously.<br /><br />Economists call it the endowment effect, which basically says that we tend to place a higher value on things once they're in our possession. We're loss averse, and while that's a great survival tactic, it can become a hindrance if it precludes you from gaining new ideas.<br /><br />And often, you have to lose one of your ideas in order to gain a new one.<br /><br />Sometimes, when I'm talking to people about something, I'll offer to them my "conclusion du jour"...that is, the conclusion I've reached and am toying with at that particular moment. It's not that I change my mind about every topic each and every day, but the phrase <em>du jour</em> refers to something that isn't necessarily going to stick around.<br /><br />The other great thing about <em>du jour</em> items in restaurants is that they're generally not a part of the regular menu. The chef in the kitchen gets to experiment with a new recipe without any long-term commitment. He's free to stumble around, put a little too much of this or that into the pot, and he doesn't have to be consistent from night-to-night. Consistency has its merits, but it can make a person weary, too.
