                      I was at a conference down in LA about a month ago. The presenters were a panel of researchers who study the effects of socialization on the human brain. They talked at length about a neurotransmitter called oxytocin. In short, it's a "feel good" chemical that gets released into our brains when we interact with others. <br /><br />And this includes interacting through social media. Posting a blog, a Facebook status update, or a Tweet...

                      A small handful of US States (not as many as you might expect) have banned the use of handheld cell phones and mobile devices while driving. In California, this happened two years ago, after a train engineer caused an accident when he was texting while operating a train.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the statistics are, but this seems like a problem that might crop up more among the younger generations.

                      Google is an amazing thing. It's something that I still take for granted on a day-to-day basis, but occasionally, I remember being in high school, very out of touch with pop culture, with a mind full of questions that I couldn't find easy answers to.<br /><br />What can you do with the C programming language?

                      On the long list of ineffective persuasion techniques is telling someone "I told you so", after someone else realizes there were incorrect. It takes several forms, many of which are quite subtle, and it's possible to say it without knowing you're saying it.<br /><br />If your aim is to tell the person they were wrong, then you're being redundant. More than likely, the person already knows they're wrong, so it's just insult on top of...

                      The annual film festival held in Santa Barbara ended last night. I heard something about our little film festival this past week: there are some films that get submitted and accepted for screening to the festival, but the filmmakers pull out of festival if they get distribution for their film between the submission and the festival itself. The reasoning? They don't like the thought of anyone who wants to see the movie to get to...

                      I've come across more than one start-up website in the last few months that is missing a link from the bottom of every page: "Careers".
