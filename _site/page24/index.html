        I was at a conference down in LA about a month ago. The presenters were a panel of researchers who study the effects of socialization on the human brain. They talked at length about a neurotransmitter called oxytocin. In short, it's a "feel good" chemical that gets released into our brains when we interact with others. <br /><br />And this includes interacting through social media. Posting a blog, a Facebook status update, or a Tweet releases oxytocin in our brain, and elates us. It's no wonder that people always have their iPhones within reach.<br /><br />It also gets released when we give to others. This is part of the reason that giving to charitable causes or pitching in to help volunteer feels good. As the presentation opened up to questions, there was a common thread amongst the questions. One girl even came out and asked it directly: "What is wrong with rich people?"<br /><br />The general feeling in the room--at least, among the people who were asking questions--was that because there's an incentive to be charitable, that anyone who's wealthy and doesn't give to others has something wrong with them.<br /><br />There's a commonly held belief that anyone who is rich got that way because they're dishonest, or because they did something dishonest. I think there's a prevalent notion that the only way to be a good person is to work long hours and for low wages.<br /><br />Money doesn't corrupt. It tends to attract the corrupted, but wealthy people are, in my experience, people just like you and me. It's easy to point to them or their money and assign blame. It's easy to point and say that they're not doing anything. Or for those that are philanthropists and do give, that they're not doing enough. But I think this is predicated on the notion that the most good can be done with money, which isn't always true, considering what lots of people without any money have managed to accomplish.<br /><br />I don't think life is actually easy for anyone...money or no money. The wealthy have some things a lot easier than others, but a lot of the work is the same. They still have to maintain relationships with their friends and family, which is one of the biggest challenges all of us face.<br /><br />I don't think the wealthy make the world a worse place. Maybe they could (or should) do more, but making callow judgments about them based on fundamental attribution errors is not the way to go about fixing things.

        A small handful of US States (not as many as you might expect) have banned the use of handheld cell phones and mobile devices while driving. In California, this happened two years ago, after a train engineer caused an accident when he was texting while operating a train.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the statistics are, but this seems like a problem that might crop up more among the younger generations. I've seen a few people in their thirties and forties texting on the road, but most older people see the inherent danger in taking that much attention off the road for the extended period of time required to compose a text message. <br /><br />I'm wondering how things change when a generation of mobile natives--that is, kids who've grown up with smart phones, and have had them as long as they can remember--start getting their licenses. Time will tell just how big of problem this is.<br /><br />In the 1970s, it was drunk driving. That's still a problem, but it was fought successfully in part by the designated driver campaign. Interestingly, these kinds of campaigns fall under the umbrella of marketing. Called <em>social marketing</em> (which is different than social media marketing), it's the creation of media campaigns to change behaviors of people...not to convince them to buy products, but instead to benefit those people or society as a whole. Think "Don't Mess With Texas" or of Woodsy Owl.<br /><br />I think it's an excellent use of marketing as a force for good, and it's something that amateurs don't do nearly enough of. David Fincher got the attention of the uppers in Hollywood in the early 1980s when he created a TV commercial that featured a smoking fetus, highlighting the dangers of smoking for pregnant mothers. It worked because it was outrageous.<br /><br />So, teens are texting while driving. There are probably worse problems around where you live. And now that we've got YouTube and almost anyone can create a quick 30-second spot, where are all the outrageous social marketing messages designed to influence for good?

        Google is an amazing thing. It's something that I still take for granted on a day-to-day basis, but occasionally, I remember being in high school, very out of touch with pop culture, with a mind full of questions that I couldn't find easy answers to.<br /><br />What can you do with the C programming language? How do you get better at product photography? Not sure. I have to go to the library and find the right book on the subject. And hopefully it's a useful book that I'll enjoy reading.<br /><br />The basis of my education was very much predicated on the notion that my head should be filled with answers. Most parents, in the interest of helping their children succeed, try to turn their kids into little humanoid versions of Google. Have a question? Ask away, and the child will spit out the answer.<br /><br />Before Google, the best way to compete from an intellectual standpoint was to have access to more knowledge in your head than others. But search engines and the Internet make that a commodity.<br /><br />What matters now, more than ever, is not merely having the knowledge (because we all have access to it), but in successfully applying that knowledge in real-world situations. That's much more difficult to teach, so it's no wonder that public education is struggling to catch up.

        On the long list of ineffective persuasion techniques is telling someone "I told you so", after someone else realizes there were incorrect. It takes several forms, many of which are quite subtle, and it's possible to say it without knowing you're saying it.<br /><br />If your aim is to tell the person they were wrong, then you're being redundant. More than likely, the person already knows they're wrong, so it's just insult on top of injury. And if your aim is to get the person to listen to you again in the future, it's still a blunder, because criticism is rarely a good way to gain credibility or influence over another person.

        My girlfriend shared an interesting story with me about the lead programmer of the company she works for. People will go to him with the question: "Is it possible to do [insert feature here]." <br /><br />His response is always the same: "Anything is possible. But how much are you willing to pay for it?"<br /><br />When people say things aren't possible, usually what they mean is: <em>given the resources available to me and the timeline, it's not possible.</em>. Or: <em>it's not worth the trade-off</em>.<br /><br />That programmer's honest response belies an intensely creative imagination. He understands that we live in a world where available time and money are most often the constraints. Most of the time, what's actually <em>possible</em> is not a constraint.

        The crowdfunding site <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> is a place where you present a product or art project idea to the community, and ask them for the money to help make your idea a reality. If enough people decide to support you, and you raise enough money, then you get to produce your idea.<br /><br />Kickstarter has enjoyed tremendous success in its short lifespan, and it has inspired  hundreds of knockoffs all trying to use the same model in different niches. (The most interesting of which, I think, is philanthropy.) But crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter suffer from one drawback that is characteristic of focus groups:<br /><br /><strong>People don't know what they want.</strong><br /><br />As Henry Ford once said, if he had asked people what they wanted, they would have said "faster horses". Focus groups would never have come up with the idea for the Nintendo Wii. If you asked people what they wanted in a new game console, more than likely, they would have asked for more CPU power. Or better graphics. <br /><br />Think of the business ideas that have become household names. It's hard to imagine Facebook or Amazon raising their seed money through crowdfunding and then launching something grand.

        The annual film festival held in Santa Barbara ended last night. I heard something about our little film festival this past week: there are some films that get submitted and accepted for screening to the festival, but the filmmakers pull out of festival if they get distribution for their film between the submission and the festival itself. The reasoning? They don't like the thought of anyone who wants to see the movie to get to see it for free.<br /><br />It's their prerogative; don't get me wrong. But there are some pretty famous and influential people that attend our little film festival. Does it really make sense to pull the screening in an effort to recoup one theater's worthy of box office receipts? Couldn't you rationally take the money you're "losing" on the one screening out of the advertising budget?<br /><br />Seems like the goal of any movie maker should be to make something that people can't help but talk about, and if that's the case, they'd be delighted to screen the movie for free, to any audience willing to watch. If you're not trying as hard as you can to start conversations amongst viewers, then no amount of PR is going to make the movie a box office success.

        I've come across more than one start-up website in the last few months that is missing a link from the bottom of every page: "Careers". It should always be nestled down there, right along with "Contact Us" and "Privacy Policy". <br /><br />It doesn't matter if you aren't even hiring...list the active departments you have and a brief overview of what each one does. Even a link to a page where you say that you <em>aren't</em> hiring, but include an email link that lets people submit a resume to human resources if they have a general interest in working for the company.<br /><br />All companies, especially small ones, should constantly be scouting for talented people. And really, if you're hiring people, you don't look like you're growing, and if that's the case, why should I do business with you?

        Occasionally, someone asks me if I think they should get rid of Windows and install Linux on their machine. People seem to think this might be a good idea because Linux isn't made by Microsoft, a company that a lot of people perceive as an EVIL CORPORATION, and because Linux is free.<br /><br />Ubuntu Linux is a pretty good operating system, and the latest version has an interface that mirrors OS X. You can request a <a href="https://shipit.ubuntu.com/">free CD</a> of the operating system here. But, how to get your mitts on it is not the question at hand. The question is: <em>should</em> you get it?<br /><br />Simple answer: no. No, you should not. <br /><br />The other day, I went to burn an audio CD for my car from some MP3 files. The burn process went just fine; I used RhythmBox, which is Linux's version of iTunes. I put the CD into my car's stereo system and the thing choked. The digital readout on my car's panel read, "Error!"<br /><br />Yes, it's 2011, and you can't burn a CD on Linux so that it <em>just works</em>. Now, I'm sure if I posted this on a Linux forum someplace, some avid user will tell me, "Oh, you just need to go into 'Preferences' and update the CD burn settings, blah blah...." And they're probably right about that point...there's probably a manual out there I could read and then everything would work great.<br /><br />But if things don't "just work", if there are things that have to be tweaked and learned, then the Linux crowd really can't ever expect a mainstream audience to adopt a new operating system.<br /><br />Here's the essence of the situation: people don't use computers for the operating system. They use them for the software that comes installed on the operating system. <br /><br />There's a critical distinction here. The fact that Linux is free, and that it now comes with a slick GUI, is cute for about the first 5 minutes. After that, the novelty wears off and the average user starts to notice that you can't install iTunes, Photoshop, IE, Microsoft Office, or a bunch of other programs that make people lead productive lives at their computer.<br /><br />For me, the trade-off is worth it. As a programmer, I'm actually less productive on a Windows machine, because once I'm there, I'm using looking for the Terminal so I can whip up some on-the-spot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">wget</a> magic to suck down some data from Twitter, and if I can't find it right away I get a little frustrated. But I'm in the minority, and a very small one, so I don't think that Microsoft Windows is in any danger because of Linux.<br /><br />Maybe if you have an old Dell desktop sitting in the corner of your basement, and it needs a more up-to-date OS, and you don't want to pay for Windows, and you're curious...go ahead and throw Linux on it. Just don't expect a whole lot.

        What if maybe...just maybe...today is the day.<br /><br />You have an idea that you've been chewing on. Maybe it's a business idea, maybe it's a screenplay you want to write, maybe you've decided that covering an entire city building in glitter-and-glue macaroni would be a good art project.<br /><br />And another thing: you've been keeping it a secret for a while.<br /><br />You don't actually want to tell anyone about it because you're afraid others won't like the idea. Or maybe you want to keep it secret because that motivates you. Or perhaps it's because you're afraid someone else will steal it and do it before you.<br /><br />Go, right now, and tell someone. A few things might come from this:<br /><br />1. Maybe your idea changes. Talking things out activates other parts of your brain than merely thinking does.<br /><br />2. Maybe the person offers good feedback. Maybe it's constructive, something you needed to hear. Maybe it adds to the idea.<br /><br />3. Maybe the person offers terrible feedback. At least you know you're better off going it alone for the time being.<br /><br />Hearing yourself describe something out loud, to another person who's listening, is incomparable to anything else. Even if it just results in an internal monologue, it's the best way to determine if you're really on to something.
