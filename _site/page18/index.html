        Here's a Canadian business in Toronto that rents bicycles via automated rental stations posted throughout the city:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9lib%27">VÃ©lib'</a><br /><br />This would be 20 times more difficult to replicate in the United States than simply publishing another diet book, but the idea is way more than 20 times better than the latter.

        There's an old expression that 90% of life is "showing up".<br /><br />Not that all you have to do is wake up, drag yourself to work, and sit there the rest of the day. That's not 90% of the way there. But once you've woken up, prepared for the day, dealt with the morning traffic, and situated yourself at work, the rest of the day kind of falls into place.<br /><br />It's acknowledging that you've heard what someone else has been saying to you the whole time. That's 90%. Your response is not as critical.<br /><br />It's getting your workout clothes on the in morning and starting to jog. Once you've got the momentum, the workout goes fine.<br /><br />Just as critical, I think, is to figure out where you should NOT show up. Showing up isn't as easy as it sounds. Sometimes, it's a downright drain on your time and energy. Best to figure out what isn't worth the effort, and then stop showing up.

        A friend tells me about an Australian shoe retailer that instituted a new policy in their store: if you try on shoes in the store, but leave without buying anything, they charge you a fee of $50.<br /><br />That's one way to do it. I'm never adverse to the idea of a business firing a portion of their customers, particularly the 20% of them that are probably taking up 80% of the businesses time or money because they're very high maintenance.<br /><br />It will have an effect...but probably not the desired one. The problem here is that this store doesn't know which customers they're punishing. It will keep lots of people away, to be sure, but it's hard to distinguish people who are trying on shoes at your store and then running home to buy them online (which is dubious) and people who wander in, try some shoes on, but don't buy anything on that particular day.<br /><br />Online commerce is little more than a substitute for traditional retail. But for people who are price shopping, buying stuff online makes more sense. 30 years ago, if you owned a small shoe store, you would probably get some business if you had a decent location for your store. Substitutes change things. It's no longer enough to just have a store, and hope that people will understand how important your business is and support you simply because you exist.<br /><br />The goal should be to make yourself more appealing and the online substitutes less appealing. Taxing the casual browsers in your store has the opposite effect.

        I heard a statistic that said the number of women-owned start-up business ventures outnumbers those started by men by a factor of 7. <br /><br />I'm not sure if this is 100% percent accurate, but it makes sense to me, for one reason: biology. In the animal kingdom, females are the necessary gender for raising and nurturing the young. The males, on the other hand, aren't as critical to the process. Once they've given up their seed, nature gets rid of them (think praying mantises), unless they're needed by the female to help care for the offspring.<br /><br />To my fellow men: this is our lot in life, and we know it. This is the reason that we insist on working at jobs as employees, where our talents and labor are exploited, and when we're used up, we are disposed of. Why do we put up with it? That's what nature has in store for us! <br /><br />Women, on the other hand, have been smart enough to realize that running an industrial manufacturing plant is not the lifestyle they want, so instead of playing the corporate game, a lot of them are running off and trying to create their own game.<br /><br />Creating your own game, with your own rules, is probably the best way to avoid being disposable.

        Saw the new movie <em>Limitless</em> yesterday. Not a bad little flick, but it's not the first movie I've seen with a miracle cure that turns an unmotivated dolt into a super-confident genius. These movies always have one thing in common: the protagonist becomes a big talker. Given their newfound knowledge, they start talking the ears off of everyone around them. And because they're so smart (presumably), there is no shortage of people standing around to listen.<br /><br />Not sure this is actually how it goes. The smarter someone gets, the more inclined they are to listen, and to listen well, at that. I'm still astonished that I went through four years of high school and four years of college and never, not once during that time, did I ever have to sit through a class that taught Strategic Learning 101.<br /><br />This is a prerequisite for everything...<em>everything</em>...in life. That we aren't formally taught it at any point in our academic lives is beyond reproach.

        This is a question I struggle with at least once a day.<br /><br />I'm come on here and write something (excuse me for being self-referential for a moment), and before I post it, I question whether or not I really ought to. Before I put a song I've written up online, I wonder whether it's worth the time of the person who might happen to stumble across it and hit the "play" button.<br /><br />I'm not going to debate whether or not there's a lot of useless sludge on the Internet, because it's an unassailable fact. Sure, there are diamonds in the rough, but when I'm looking for diamonds, I don't rush to the rough. This is why offline media won't be supplanted by the web, and why traditional publishers and record companies will always have a place in the world. (It might be a different, smaller place, but it's still there.)<br /><br />But still, writing on here once a day might be overkill, particularly if people reading it think that I only hit upon a good idea once a month. Or every two months. If this is true, why not just write once a month and leave the dross unpublished?<br /><br />Two reasons for me (and they probably apply to you as well):<br /><br />1. Most creators can't separate their gems from the dross.<br /><br />2. The gems are born of the dross. <br /><br />The second one is immensely important, because most people will tell you not to bother until you've got the talent to do nothing but great work. And this mentality is probably the leading reason why the potential for a lot of great work ends up getting squandered.

        Here's an elevator pitch that I've heard several times from many people since I moved to southern California: healthy fast food. Set up a drive-through where people can get nutritious meals on the go.<br /><br />It's really not a bad idea: offer convenience in the health food market. (It doesn't necessarily have to take the form of a drive-through.) The problem is that people who are eating healthy are trying very hard to distance themselves from the fast food concept, so trying to win them over with that pitch might be futile. And for the droves of people who eat fast food, they don't have a fast food problem: the burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salads work just fine. And the food itself has been commoditized, so it's cheap, and it might be difficult for a place serving vegetables to compete on price.<br /><br />In my mind, here's the springboard for this concept: a drive-through juice bar. There's enough people who frequent smoothie and juice bars to make it a viable concept, and getting a glass of liquid to go is only a stone's throw away from a Frappicino at a drive-through Starbucks. <br /><br />I'm sure that several of these exist, but I'm not aware of one in my own town. Is there one in yours?

        A statistic that I've heard a few places: if all Americans started eating the alloted daily recommended quantities of fruits and vegetables every day, our agricultural system does not currently have enough land allocated to fruits and vegetables to meet the demand. (I can't verify if that's actually true, but I'm inclined to believe it.)<br /><br />Reputedly, Wal-Mart is a leader in stocking their stores with organic produce. They did this because their customers asked for it. Because Wal-Mart is a company that holds a tremendous amount of bargaining power with their suppliers, they were able to get organic produce for cheap. And several of their competitors who also stock produce decided to follow suit, partly because Wal-Mart brought the cost of fruit down and because it raised the bar for customer expectations.<br /><br />I'm not a pure libertarian, because I don't think a free-for-all market for businesses is always a good idea. But if you happen to believe in less government, I think you should be writing letters to businesses in lieu of your representatives.

        A co-worker of mine made an interesting point yesterday: ten years ago, socially responsible consumers were looking at the clothes they were buying and trying to determine if they were having a negative impact on the country where they were produced. People didn't want to buy sneakers if they were put together by children working in a sweatshop somewhere in Asia.<br /><br />The problem with this is that while this might prevent some undue suffering by nudging the invisible hand, it does nothing to propel the products being produced in a better direction. A much more common trend these days is people looking not only for products that do no harm, but ones that actually generate a positive social impact. <a href="http://www.toms.com/">Tom's Shoes</a> is probably the best example of this kind of a product with the giving built in.<br /><br />A sign of the times. And a promising one, at that.

        I gave a small donation to <a href="http://www.foodbanksbc.org/">my local food bank</a> about six months ago, in response to reports that they were falling on hard times and were possibly going to start cutting their programs.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I got a solicitation in the mail from them, asking for more money. I wrote a note to them telling them while I was extremely grateful for their service to our community, and while I was happy to help when I could, I wanted to cease any further direct mailings from them.<br /><br />Six pieces of "junk" mail later, and I now know they didn't listen to me.<br /><br />Problem is, I've talked to some people about this, and they tell me that while the direct mailings from charities are spammy, they work. If you send out envelopes to people asking them for money, enough of them come back with checks in them to make it worth doing. Junk mail, it would seem, is the price of funding a lot of a major non-profit organizations.<br /><br />But until someone devises a better system that doesn't have to be fundamentally flawed in order to work, an opt-out system would be nice. Think of it this way: if you give past donors the option of never hearing from you again, you save on the postage it would cost to mail that person. Call it another donation, if you're prefer.
