                      There's an old expression that 90% of life is "showing up".Not that all you have to do is wake up, drag yourself to work, and sit there the rest of the day. That's not 90% of the way there. But once you've woken up, prepared for the day, dealt with the morning traffic, and situated yourself at work, the rest of the day kind of falls into place.It's acknowledging that you've heard what someone else...

                      A friend tells me about an Australian shoe retailer that instituted a new policy in their store: if you try on shoes in the store, but leave without buying anything, they charge you a fee of $50.That's one way to do it. I'm never adverse to the idea of a business firing a portion of their customers, particularly the 20% of them that are probably taking up 80% of the businesses time or money because...

                      I heard a statistic that said the number of women-owned start-up business ventures outnumbers those started by men by a factor of 7. I'm not sure if this is 100% percent accurate, but it makes sense to me, for one reason: biology. In the animal kingdom, females are the necessary gender for raising and nurturing the young. The males, on the other hand, aren't as critical to the process. Once they've given up their seed,...

                      Saw the new movie Limitless yesterday. Not a bad little flick, but it's not the first movie I've seen with a miracle cure that turns an unmotivated dolt into a super-confident genius. These movies always have one thing in common: the protagonist becomes a big talker. Given their newfound knowledge, they start talking the ears off of everyone around them. And because they're so smart (presumably), there is no shortage of people standing around to...

                      This is a question I struggle with at least once a day.I'm come on here and write something (excuse me for being self-referential for a moment), and before I post it, I question whether or not I really ought to.

                      Here's an elevator pitch that I've heard several times from many people since I moved to southern California: healthy fast food. Set up a drive-through where people can get nutritious meals on the go.It's really not a bad idea: offer convenience in the health food market. (It doesn't necessarily have to take the form of a drive-through.) The problem is that people who are eating healthy are trying very hard to distance themselves from the...

                      A statistic that I've heard a few places: if all Americans started eating the alloted daily recommended quantities of fruits and vegetables every day, our agricultural system does not currently have enough land allocated to fruits and vegetables to meet the demand. (I can't verify if that's actually true, but I'm inclined to believe it.)Reputedly, Wal-Mart is a leader in stocking their stores with organic produce. They did this because their customers asked for it....

                      A co-worker of mine made an interesting point yesterday: ten years ago, socially responsible consumers were looking at the clothes they were buying and trying to determine if they were having a negative impact on the country where they were produced. People didn't want to buy sneakers if they were put together by children working in a sweatshop somewhere in Asia.The problem with this is that while this might prevent some undue suffering by nudging...

                      I gave a small donation to my local food bank about six months ago, in response to reports that they were falling on hard times and were possibly going to start cutting their programs.Shortly thereafter, I got a solicitation in the mail from them, asking for more money. I wrote a note to them telling them while I was extremely grateful for their service to our community, and while I was happy to help when...
