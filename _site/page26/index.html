        If there's one thing that terrifies a lot of managers, it's having employees that are smarter than they are. Or, even scarier, having employees that hold a dissenting viewpoint.<br /><br />This is absurd. I'm not sure who it was that thought the military's systematic style of getting people to fall in line could be applied to the world of business without serious repercussions--maybe Henry Ford contributed in a big way with his assembly line--but it's got to be stopped, before it goes any further.<br /><br />Individuality, when it adds value, becomes a point of leverage...for the individual. Systems tend to educate this out of us. They want us to be the same as one another because it makes us easily replaceable. <br /><br />Trying to get everyone on the exact same page is the worst thing any boss could attempt to do, simply because the lesson of diversity rings pretty clear: diverse groups are better are solving problems than groups comprised of people all trying to do or say the same thing.

        If you have an idea that you're going to spend a lot of time working on, do you tell people about it or keep it a secret? Like most of us, I have lots of ideas, a handful of which I make an effort to follow through on. I'm still undecided on the best approach.<br /><br />Secrecy has its merits. I'm usually not worried about someone stealing my ideas, because in my experience, most people don't do that and ideas are, by themselves, plentiful. It's a different reason for me: if I keep something a secret, it creates this itch inside of me to get it finished and get it out the door. I'm always afraid that if I start to discuss an idea that I'll end up talking the idea to death. Making myself keep it secret, until after it's done, is a way of dangling a carrot in front of myself. I keep myself motivated with the satisfaction of telling people about, but only <em>after</em> the fact.<br /><br />And yet, there's little to match what happens when you bounce ideas off of other people. If you have a good idea, and you tell everyone you know about it, chances are their reactions are going to be immensely helpful to you in shaping or refining the idea, usually in a way that makes it better.<br /><br />I'm torn about this, but I am curious if any other creative types (that would be you, whoever you might be) have given this any thought. Do you keep things secret or not?

        Starbucks is working to make a 100% recyclable cup. They've been working at this goal for several years now, and suffice it to say, it's not an easy challenge. Part of the problem is that, despite any innovation in the cup's materials, their needs to be recycling programs in place, people have to have access to them, and they have to be mindful enough to actually recycle their cups.<br /><br />We're creatures of habit. And I'm definitely one of the guilty ones...almost every day, I get a cup of coffee from someplace, in a single-use cup that invariably ends up in the trash. The public trash cans and sidewalks close to coffee shops are rife with littered coffee cups. Even if we suddenly had a cup bestowed upon us that was recyclable, it's a safe bet that most of them would still get thrown away.<br /><br />Here's the current deal, as I understand it: bring in your own travel mug, and Starbucks will fill it with coffee and give you a 10 cent discount on your drink.<br /><br />There's a couple of problems here. First, that deal is written in such small print in Starbucks's stores that most people are not aware of it. Second, I'm not convinced that 10 cents is really enough to motivate people to start carrying around their own cups. It's a matter of convenience.<br /><br />Besides upping the amount, the incentive itself is backwards; instead of offering a discount, there should be a cup tax. If they flipped the price structure, so that coffee drinks were listed cheaper on the menu, but it rings up with an extra charge at the register, people couldn't help but ask: "What's that extra charge for?"<br /><br />"That's the paper cup tax."<br /><br />This, I think, would get people to pay attention to the cups they're discarding.

        In my apartment, I have a white board hanging up...in my living room.<br /><br />I live in a pretty small place, so it's arguable that, given a few more rooms or more space to dedicate to work-related activities, the white board would be sequestered away from general living space. Or, given better taste or interior design, maybe I'd have other things with which to decorate my walls.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I've spent too much time at start-ups working as a programmer.<br /><br />Not sure what the reason is, but I firmly believe that a lot more people should have white boards hanging up in their homes. Day to day, it becomes a place where you can sketch out ideas, free form, very conveniently. And if you make a mistake or need to start over, you just erase. Easy.<br /><br />I've been to lots of parties or gatherings of people over the years. I can think of dozens or even hundreds of times when one person was trying to explain an idea or thought of theirs to others. It would have helped immensely if there had been a white board within reach, and they could have just grabbed a dry erase marker and <em>drawn</em> their idea for everyone else to see.<br /><br />Maybe the white boards don't become most peoples' living rooms. That just means someone needs to create one that has a Thomas Kinkade cover that can be drawn down over it when it's not in use. <br /><br />But until someone invents that, I think you should order one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KO9JB0/">right here and now</a>, and start letting the creative juices flow.

        Maslow has a hierarchy for the needs of human beings. At the bottom of pyramid are our basic survival needs; at the top is self-actualization, which is our lifelong pursuit to (stealing a phrase from the US military) be all that we can be.<br /><br />Aarron Walter shares a <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/design/emotional-interface-design-the-gateway-to-passionate-users/">different hierarchy with us</a>...this one is the hierarchy of software interfaces. Most people reading this aren't software developers, but it's 2011, so just about everyone is forced to interact with software at home and work. With this in mind, it's worth taking a look:<br /><br /><img style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 238px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1tpBEJ9JZlk/TTklmkTjuSI/AAAAAAAAAOY/jfL4pUGAt7A/s320/maslow-hierarchy-interface-design.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5564520159103924514" /><br /><br />In brief, here's what each level means, from top to bottom:<br /><br />1. "Functional" - it works.<br />2. "Reliable" - it works <em>consistently</em>.<br />3. "Usable" - it's intuitive.<br />4. "Pleasurable" - I actually enjoy using it.<br /><br />The first level, <em>functional</em>, is typical of websites built for government entities, especially local municipalities. If you've ever gone online and filed for unemployment, the web form you had to fill out might have made you scream. In this case, "functional" is synonymous with "good enough". As soon as the programmer building it had it working at a bare minimum, the rest of the budget was slashed and it was deployed as it was.<br /><br />Reliable means you don't have to worry about it crashing on you. The IRS has a website that's both functional and reliable. It works, and you can count on it to work, but I'll be goddamned if it's possible to actually <em>find</em> anything on there. The site is so disorganized and impossible to make sense of that it remains the primary reason that I decided never to go into tax accountancy, or ever make any effort to work for the IRS.<br /><br />Usable means you can figure out what the hell is going on without have to reach for the booklet that the software shipped with...if there even is a book. This is actually pretty tricky to get right. Microsoft Word thought they solved the problem ten years ago by giving their users a <a href="http://1thought2many.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/word-paperclip.jpg?w=193&h=169" target="_blank">paperclip</a> to talk to. Facebook gets it wrong about once every six months when they scramble up their layout and move everything around. ("I'm going to look at this person's photos...oh, wait, that part of the page <em>moved</em>, so I'm actually clicking on the 'Share Photos' button...?")<br /><br />Pleasurable is even harder to accomplish, and it's rare that people pull it off. The sites you visit by choice on a daily basis fall into these categories: Netflix, iTunes, Amazon. Whatever they may be, something about the experience makes you genuinely want to come back. This is the kind of software experience that Apple has managed to create on their computers, smartphones, and now tablets.<br /><br />When you create software, it's generally best practice to write a specification: that is, write out in plain English what the thing <em>does</em> before you start writing code. Generally, the specification can cover the first three levels.<br /><br />My friend posed the question to me: how do you create a specification for the top level? In other words, how do you spec out "pleasurable"?<br /><br />Simple answer: you can't. If you could spec it out, then you could outsource it and send the work overseas. It goes without saying that for a company like Apple, this would be the beginning of the end.<br /><br />Even if you're not in software, chances are good someone is paying you for doing work with merits that fall into a similar pyramid. What's at the top of your pyramid? When was the last time you got there?

        The <em>Freakonomics</em> guys are very good at pointing out that behavior in society is driven by small incentives. Set up a system in which people can donate blood for free, then you're going to get good Samaritans donating blood. Offer $5 for a pint, and you're going to get a slightly different mix of people. The good Samaritans will still be there, but there will be others doing it for the five dollars. (That's cigarette money for the day.)<br /><br />But if you offer $5000 for a pint of blood, you can be sure that people will come out of the woodwork to donate blood. A whole different batch of people would suddenly show up with blood to give. Problem is, it might be animal blood, or it might be someone else's blood, that they're attempting to pass off as their own. Benevolence is displaced by greed.<br /><br />Several years ago, Amazon told its customer service folks that their performance evaluations would be based on the number of calls they took in a hour. The result? Customers getting hung up on prematurely.<br /><br />I doubt anyone would think it's a good idea to offer $5000 per pint of donated blood. But stock traders on Wall Street often have year-end bonuses world several hundreds of thousands of dollars dangled in their faces. Presumably, this is done so they'll perform better at their jobs and make smarter trades.<br /><br />Up the reward, and (especially) if it's a monetary one, there's a good chance that all you've done is given people an incentive to game the system.

        If you're doing anything that matters to you, it has to be. The problem is that the best way to steer clear of failure is to play it safe. You avoid taking any risks whatsoever.

        Ten years ago, I sat down with someone who knows a whole hell of a lot more about computers than I do and asked him about the increasing use of mobile phones for targeted advertising. The way he saw it, he told me, was that since cell phones came equipped with GPS, they could figure out where people were and deliver ad messages via SMS text message. <br /><br />So, if they detected that you were getting off at a particular exit on the highway, and there was a Wendy's at that exit, that might send you a text message suggesting you eat at Wendy's.<br /><br />That was almost eight years ago. Does anyone still believe that we're going to start getting SMS text messages as ads on our phones? Probably not. We got it wrong because the mobile phones of today look and function radically different than they did back then.<br /><br />In general, human beings are actually pretty poor predictors of what the future is going to look like. This rule doesn't just apply to technology. I'm not sure that anyone saw Chuck Berry, Kurt Cobain, or Timbaland coming ahead of time. They just showed up and took music in a different direction.<br /><br />Civil rights took a while to get into place, and while it's still an ongoing struggle, I think that, as a society, we've made a lot of progress in the right directon. People in the 1930's would never have guessed our country would look the way it does today. So, it's anybody's guess what the future is really going to look like.<br /><br />Maybe it's not only something to guess at; maybe it's also an opportunity. Since the future is a blank slate, it's ours to mold to our liking. And if nobody really knows what tomorrow will look like, no one is in any position to tell you that your vision is wrong.

      <div class="content">
        Last week, I was looking at the tour dates and locations for a popular music artist. It was pretty clear to me that her manager just booked her at large venues in the most popular cities in the country. LA, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and so on. You've probably heard of most of them. This is common with big name acts.<br /><br />My question: are the big cities where a lot of the fans actually live?<br /><br />Sure, it's not a stretch to say that if you're a popular musician with a loyal fan base, you'll draw a larger crowd in big cities, simply because more people live there. And people on the fringes, in smaller cities, will likely make the trek to big cities to attend a show.<br /><br />I still think the big-city tour schedule just assumes an even distribution of fans. I also don't think that's always a safe assumption. It's an easy one, because it means the manager booking the tour dates doesn't have to make any effort to figure out where the fans actually live.<br /><br />Imagine you're a big musical act...not the Rolling Stones, but let's say you've sold a couple hundred thousand albums. You're comfortable enough to have options. On tour, you skip Boise, ID, because less than 10,000 people live there. And that's your right. But...what if there are 500 really dedicated fans who love your music? What if they really want to see you perform live? What do you think it would mean to them if you performed in their town? Isn't it worth figuring out where the dedicated fans live and going to them?<br /><br />Maybe big name acts are worn out, tired in their old age, or maybe most of them don't have to care. I can buy that possibility.<br /><br />But I still think most of them don't know where their fans actually live. Maybe there are tools for this for bands with MySpace pages, that let you analyze where clusters of fans live based on their location. But not everyone is on MySpace. And it's not clear from looking at those numbers who the dedicated, passionate fans are, versus the occasional listener.<br /><br />So, if you're a smaller act just getting off the ground, here's a suggestion if you really want to thrill your fans. I'm not a touring manager, and I've never been on tour as a musician, so this is untested, but I think it could work if done correctly.<br /><br />Record every live performance you do. How you do it is up to you, but it can be as simple as hooking a simple mic up to a Sony Digital Voice Recorder, recording the whole set as a single MP3, and then splitting it up into separate tracks later with a free program like Audacity. <br /><br />In the middle of your set, tell the audience that you're making a live recording of your set, and that it will be available for free download or purchase in a few day's time. Tell those interested to sign up on a list by giving you their email address. (I'm assuming you're not playing to a stadium full of people, but in a much smaller venue.) When the album is ready, you say, you'll send everyone an email with a link to where they can download/purchase it.<br /><br />Follow through on your promise. Ask them if you can contact them again in the future if you come back on tour through their town, or if you release a new album. Let them opt-in to receiving relevant news about you. Save this list of emails in a database, noting the location where you got each email address. It can be an Excel file or Google doc spreadsheet, but use something you are capable of managing, and don't lose it. On future tours, update it with new entries. Make note of the people who showed up a second time.<br /><br />It's an imperfect approach. I know that for acts with a minuscule fan base, this tactic isn't worth the trouble, and for quickly growing acts, it would quickly become unwieldy. And it's difficult to say what portion of a dedicated fan base would actually take you up on your offer. But I think it would help smaller bands out, because it helps engage them directly with their fans, and later, when you plan your next tour, you have permission to contact your fans to let them know you're coming.<br /><br />And if nothing else, at least you know where they are.

        Professional magicians tend to agree on this point: Houdini was not the greatest magician who ever lived. If you base your judgment on technical proficiency, he didn't even come close.<br /><br />And yet, if you ask almost anyone to name the greatest magician of all time, they'll probably say Houdini.<br /><br />This is because Houdini was bold enough to use himself as a large part of his own act. He was one of the first magicians to play up the act of locking himself into a trunk and having to get out. When he chose to start doing this, it was unclear whether or not a magician could make a living as an escape artist. <br /><br />We tend to avoid things that are unclear to us, and gravitate to things enshrouded in clarity. Muddy waters can run deep, but you can't be sure until you take the plunge.
