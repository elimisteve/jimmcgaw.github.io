                      There are several words used in dialects around the world that don't have a direct translation into English. I find these cases interesting, since they belie a cultural difference. There are concepts that exist in other parts of the world, to which they've dedicated a word, but we haven't acknowledged them to that extent in English. How, exactly, is that possible?The great thing about the German language is that it's permissible to form new words...

                      If there's one thing that terrifies a lot of managers, it's having employees that are smarter than they are. Or, even scarier, having employees that hold a dissenting viewpoint.This is absurd. I'm not sure who it was that thought the military's systematic style of getting people to fall in line could be applied to the world of business without serious repercussions--maybe Henry Ford contributed in a big way with his assembly line--but it's got to...

                      If you have an idea that you're going to spend a lot of time working on, do you tell people about it or keep it a secret? Like most of us, I have lots of ideas, a handful of which I make an effort to follow through on. I'm still undecided on the best approach.Secrecy has its merits. I'm usually not worried about someone stealing my ideas, because in my experience, most people don't do...

                      Starbucks is working to make a 100% recyclable cup. They've been working at this goal for several years now, and suffice it to say, it's not an easy challenge. Part of the problem is that, despite any innovation in the cup's materials, their needs to be recycling programs in place, people have to have access to them, and they have to be mindful enough to actually recycle their cups.We're creatures of habit. And I'm definitely...

                      In my apartment, I have a white board hanging up...in my living room.I live in a pretty small place, so it's arguable that, given a few more rooms or more space to dedicate to work-related activities, the white board would be sequestered away from general living space. Or, given better taste or interior design, maybe I'd have other things with which to decorate my walls.Maybe it's because I've spent too much time at start-ups working...

                      Maslow has a hierarchy for the needs of human beings. At the bottom of pyramid are our basic survival needs; at the top is self-actualization, which is our lifelong pursuit to (stealing a phrase from the US military) be all that we can be.Aarron Walter shares a different hierarchy with us...this one is the hierarchy of software interfaces.

                      The Freakonomics guys are very good at pointing out that behavior in society is driven by small incentives. Set up a system in which people can donate blood for free, then you're going to get good Samaritans donating blood. Offer $5 for a pint, and you're going to get a slightly different mix of people. The good Samaritans will still be there, but there will be others doing it for the five dollars. (That's cigarette...

                      If you're doing anything that matters to you, it has to be. The problem is that the best way to steer clear of failure is to play it safe. You avoid taking any risks whatsoever. You mitigate yourself right into mediocrity.If you refuse to let it be an option, then you're setting yourself up for failure.

                      Ten years ago, I sat down with someone who knows a whole hell of a lot more about computers than I do and asked him about the increasing use of mobile phones for targeted advertising. The way he saw it, he told me, was that since cell phones came equipped with GPS, they could figure out where people were and deliver ad messages via SMS text message. So, if they detected that you were getting...

                      Last week, I was looking at the tour dates and locations for a popular music artist. It was pretty clear to me that her manager just booked her at large venues in the most popular cities in the country. LA, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and so on. You've probably heard of most of them. This is common with big name acts.My question: are the big cities where a lot of the fans actually live?Sure, it's...
