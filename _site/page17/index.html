                      It's wrong to assume that business management principles can be applied to the problems of public education. First of all, a lot of business management philosophy is flawed; it doesn't work out in the business world. A lot of common sense in the business world that people take for granted is broken, but they don't know it because, hey, they're taking it for granted. And the reason why you'd take broken rules from one domain...

                      Read a book about social media marketing and you'll probably get a lot of the same old ideas. Here's a perfect example: if you have a hair salon, take "before" and "after" shots of your customers when they come in, friend them on Facebook, and then tag them in the photos. The idea is simple: you build a photo album of customers, and each time you tag one of them, each of their friends get...

                      It doesn't take too long to recognize that people respond to things that elicit fear.We're barraged with gobs of information, day in and day out, and we can't possibly acknowledge all of it. So we're selective about the things to which we grant our attention. And the things that are victorious are those things that make us uneasy or afraid.And so it is that everything becomes a problem. And not just a problem, but an...

                      A couple of years ago, Google fundamentally changed something about their search results: the ones you see are based on who you are.If you have a Google account under which you do lots of browsing, try opening another browser or go to another computer where you're not logged in.

                      The two seem like they might be mutually exclusive, don't they?Managing to get through four years of high school or college with a flawless GPA of 4.0 is an accomplishment. There's no doubt in my mind about that. Someone who works that hard to pull that off is definitely an achiever.But an overachiever? I'm not convinced.At the heart of the GPA (or SAT/ACT scores, for that matter) is the term standardization. I don't think there's...

                      I've written several times before, and I still believe very firmly, that everyone ought to have a blog. (I'm not flexible on this.)The reason is meta-cognition. Yes, I'm aware that most blogs are and will continue to be exercises in self-indulgence on the part of the person writing them. That doesn't matter; the value doesn't lie in the content, or in the size of the audience, but in the act of writing.When you commit it...

                      I don't think the world needs any more iPad or iPhone cases. At least, not without a little bit of innovation.It's a mistake to think that Wal-Mart or McDonald's are businesses that exist in the middle of the bell curve. As far as audiences go, they are somewhere in the middle, but as far as strategy goes, they are on the fringes, and they're key selling point: cheap.Cheap doesn't mean mass, cheap doesn't mean a...

                      ...probably isn't where you've been looking for it.The best "aha!" moments of my life have come from answers to questions that I didn't ask. The come from the fringes, from a collision of ideas from two different domains that I never would have put together using logic or reason.A lot of joy and insight has struck me while I've been parked in front of computer because, hey, that's where I spend most of my time...

                      The Trader Joe's closest to my house offers something very small that makes a big impact: free coffee. If you go in there to shop on any given weekend day (it might be any day, for all I know), there's a caraffe of coffee brewing at the back, and everyone is free to help themselves to a small cup that they can nurse as they wander around the store.There was a Superbowl commercial about 14...

                      There's one reason that I know my car, apartment, and underworldly possessions are most like safe from theft: they're all very small targets.My car doesn't have a high bluebook value, so it's unlikely anyone will risk driving off with it in the middle of the night. That's protecting it far more than the car alarm is. And I know that my deadbolt is pretty much worthless. A dedicated cat burglar could bypass it without breaking...
