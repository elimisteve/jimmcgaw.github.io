        It's wrong to assume that business management principles can be applied to the problems of public education. <br /><br />First of all, a lot of business management philosophy is flawed; it doesn't work out in the business world. A lot of common sense in the business world that people take for granted is broken, but they don't know it because, hey, they're taking it for granted. And the reason why you'd take broken rules from one domain to try and fix another is idiotic.<br /><br />Here's one management principle I strongly agree with: don't delegate something to me if you don't trust me to do a good job of it. If you don't like what I produce or what I have to say, please do it yourself. I'm interested in continually learning to improve myself, so I will pay attention to my own mistakes, but I won't take exact directives.<br /><br />By the same token, if you know exactly how you want your kids to be taught, then the solution is simple: <em>homeschool them</em>. If you choose not to do this, and instead send them off to public school, don't be overly critical of any of your child's teacher's methods. <br /><br />Go to parent-teacher night, keep your mouth shut, and <em>listen</em>. Offer questions or suggestions where you feel it's necessary, but respect the boundaries of the parent-teacher relationship.<br /><br />If you're trusting your kids to the teachers of the public education system, let them do their jobs. If you're going to delegate, then you don't get to issue orders.

        Read a book about social media marketing and you'll probably get a lot of the same old ideas. Here's a perfect example: if you have a hair salon, take "before" and "after" shots of your customers when they come in, friend them on Facebook, and then tag them in the photos. The idea is simple: you build a photo album of customers, and each time you tag one of them, each of their friends get exposed to your business when the photos appear in their news feed.<br /><br />It's not a bad idea, but the effectiveness of this kind of strategy wears over time. I imagine that the first humorous beer commercial ever to air on television had quite an effect on its viewers, but when the next beer company that decided to make one too, it didn't work as well. With each copycat, the effectiveness of any particular strategy degrades.<br /><br />Somewhere, hundreds of advertisers are trying to replicate the success of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE">Old Spice's The Man Your Many Could Smell Like</a>. The reason it worked was because it was new and outrageous. That means when you try to copy it, it's not outrageous and it doesn't work.<br /><br />There is no formula for getting people's attention; not like there is a formula for computing the Price-Earnings Ratio. It makes sense that you can go to school and get an accounting degree. But marketing? The reason that it's in the business college in most universities and not a liberal arts degree is something I'll never understand.<br /><br />A good reason to mistrust anyone who claims to be a "social media expert". Even those who come close to expert level are still working it out.

        It doesn't take too long to recognize that people respond to things that elicit fear.<br /><br />We're barraged with gobs of information, day in and day out, and we can't possibly acknowledge all of it. So we're selective about the things to which we grant our attention. And the things that are victorious are those things that make us uneasy or afraid.<br /><br />And so it is that everything becomes a problem. And not just a problem, but an urgent one, at that. If your job is to raise awareness of animal cruelty/homelessness/the environment/politics/etc, then your job is to paint that thing as an urgent problem that people need to worry about.<br /><br />My strategy for the last few years has been to ignore the people who are trying to get me to worry. I don't think the world is perfect...not by a long shot. I think there are lots of problems that could benefit from our attention, if we paid more attention to them.<br /><br />Here's the big problem: <em>problems are not solved by our attention alone</em>.<br /><br />It's only when that attention translates to someone else, like a monetary donation or personal action, that a problem might be solved.<br /><br />And so I ignore people who are trying to give me something else to worry about, because I don't want to give them the satisfaction. I don't want to let them think they're correct in trying to elicit fear from people. Mongering fear is at best a short-term strategy, and there's not guarantee that this helps solve problems over the long haul. <br /><br />Instead, what I choose to respond favorably to are the people who are taking personal action. If you're doing something, and you're not trying to rope me in by trying to scare me, then I'll stop and watch. These are the people who get (and I think deserve) my attention.<br /><br />Actions might speak louder than words, but the people listening are more likely to respond to words than actions, simply because it's easier.

        A couple of years ago, Google fundamentally changed something about their search results: the ones you see are based on who you are.<br /><br />If you have a Google account under which you do lots of browsing, try opening another browser or go to another computer where you're not logged in. Try doing a few Google searches when you're logged in as yourself, then as an anonymous user not logged in. <br /><br />It make take some trial and error, but eventually, you should see some disparities in the results. Google is tailoring the results they're giving you based on your own tastes, preferences, and what you clicked on in the past.<br /><br />I'm certainly not going to dispute the convenience of this, and as far as Google is concerned, it makes a lot of sense. Their mission has always been to provide people with quality results, so giving each person their own custom results for any given search makes logical sense. (Also, it would be immensely more difficult for Bing to scrape these results and offer them up to their own users.)<br /><br />In and of itself, this isn't a bad thing, but the Internet itself is increasingly driven by commercialization. In the advertising world, marketers studying people's behavior and trying to figure out how to get people to buy things is nothing new, but this is probably the first time that technology has the potential to put each individual inside of a bubble that has the potential to be divorced from reality.<br /><br />How do you feel about global warming? Are you politically conservative or liberal? There's a good chance the Internet knows. And there's a good chance it will eventually be willing to serve up results and content that reinforce your own beliefs, instead of showing you everything. The incentive to do this is clear: feeling as though you're right feels good, and people who feel good (especially about themselves) are more likely to buy things.<br /><br />Granted, this is nothing new. One of the key features of the Internet is that you can easily go looking for whatever information your heart desires. People creating their own bubbles is a function of their drive to reinforce what they know, not the quality of the information available to them.<br /><br />But this is probably the first time that reinforcement will be technologically possible by means of <em>push</em> instead of <em>pull</em>. When you go searching online and off, you are pulling information towards you, and you're well within your rights to decide what kind of information that should be. But when the medium you're using to poll for information develops a brain (e.g. Google's neural networks) and starts pushing the kind of information you want towards you, a kind of feedback loop is created that strengthens the effect of the reinforcement.<br /><br />This wouldn't be a big deal, except for the perception of objectivity that people have about Internet search results. The change in Google's algorithm to tailor search results to each individual user happened without most people knowing it, and this part of their search is being updated and refined all the time. It's shifting under everyone's feet, largely without them knowing, and this is where the crux of the issue lies.<br /><br />What happens when the Internet becomes our own personal "yes man"?

        The two seem like they might be mutually exclusive, don't they?<br /><br />Managing to get through four years of high school or college with a flawless GPA of 4.0 is an accomplishment. There's no doubt in my mind about that. Someone who works that hard to pull that off is definitely an achiever.<br /><br />But an <em>over</em>achiever? I'm not convinced.<br /><br />At the heart of the GPA (or SAT/ACT scores, for that matter) is the term <em>standardization</em>. I don't think there's anything wrong with standardized tests, but the education of the individual suffers when standardized tests become the focus of the educational process instead of merely a benchmark. And even in the best case scenario, when they <em>are</em> used only as benchmarks, there's a limit to what they can measure. They are quantities, not qualities...the only quality of an individual that good test scores offer is that they've figured out how to play the game.<br /><br />Is that the person you want to hire? The individual who will never initiate or innovate, but follow orders? The person who will figure out what you want to hear and then tell it to you? The person who figures out how the system works and then games it, instead of trying to re-invent the system or re-write the rules? If the answer is yes, what kind of company are you running?<br /><br />I don't cling to personal vendettas, but in my time at college, there were three separate classes where I would, on occasion, challenge the professor and what they were telling us. They hated me for it. And I'm pretty sure that the grades I got in those classes reflected the fact that I was being a big pain in the butt. The people who got 4.0s in the class were jotting down notes and spewing back the same information at the professor via tests and essays.<br /><br />Yes, I'm probably a little more difficult to manage. (But to my credit, I don't engage in workplace gossip.) <br /><br />I'm not claiming I'm an overachiever, because I'm my own worst flatterer. What I think is that overachieving is a process, not an event, and an overachiever is someone who lives that process. You strive not to follow in the footsteps of those who came before you, not to follow the map they hand you when you enroll in college classes, but to create your own map that will lead you someplace new.<br /><br />If you're a student, shoot for the 4.0, by all means, because it can't possibly hurt you in the long run. There will never be a shortage of employers anxious to swoop in and give you a salary to do exactly what they tell you. But if you're sifting through a stack of resumes as a hiring manager, don't look at the 4.0s...look at those who fell short, and try to determine why they fell short. There's might be an interesting story to be heard.

        I've written several times before, and I still believe very firmly, that everyone ought to have a blog. (I'm not flexible on this.)<br /><br />The reason is meta-cognition. Yes, I'm aware that most blogs are and will continue to be exercises in self-indulgence on the part of the person writing them. That doesn't matter; the value doesn't lie in the content, or in the size of the audience, but in the act of writing.<br /><br />When you commit it to paper, it's not what you think, it's what you can defend. It's what you can explain. And even if you do nothing else than put your own thoughts into works, the very act of writing about your own thoughts makes you more aware of them and forces you to articulate them.<br /><br />I'm not saying anything new here. Most of the dreaded blogs about blogging on the Internet discuss these points at length. But I think a case (and a reasonable one, at that) can be made against this line of thinking.<br /><br />I know lots of people who won't blog because they're sternly against putting their own ideas out there for people to criticize. They're firmly situated in their convictions and have absolutely no interest in debating them with a bunch of strangers online.  <br /><br />If you believe in something, then dammit, you <em>should</em> believe in it, and push forward as hard as you can. There's always the risk that you'll end up crawling so far up your own butt that you lose perspective on things. But if taking your ideas online, for public scrutiny, is going to instill in you so much self-doubt that you lose sight of your own vision, then there are probably very compelling reasons not to let your opinions out into the open.<br /><br />I work very hard, each and every day, to not be head-over-heels for my own ideas. Me, I think it's healthy to force yourself (and allow others) to question what you think you know, no matter how you go about trying to do it. But perhaps I lack conviction. And maybe that's a fault of mine that's largely responsible for those bouts of time in my life when I feel as though I've lost my way.

        I don't think the world needs any more iPad or iPhone cases. At least, not without a little bit of innovation.<br /><br />It's a mistake to think that Wal-Mart or McDonald's are businesses that exist in the middle of the bell curve. As far as audiences go, they are somewhere in the middle, but as far as strategy goes, they are on the fringes, and they're key selling point: cheap.<br /><br />Cheap doesn't mean mass, cheap doesn't mean a good idea, and cheap doesn't even mean profitable. (Would you rather have a business with $200,000 in sales and $50,000 profit or $500,000 in sales and $10,000 in profit?) Cheap is one way of standing out, but certainly not in a market that's saturated.<br /><br />One of my favorite success stories is <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/">DODOcase</a>. Yes, they make a product that you can get anywhere else, for cheaper and faster. If you order a DODOcase, you don't get it in a few days. You pay more for it, and you have to wait a few weeks before they ship it.<br /><br />So why do it?<br /><br />Because of the story. Because the cases themselves are made by artisans here in the United States, in San Francisco. When you order one, they haven't started making it yet, and after you do place an order, they get to work making one for you. You can see videos on their site that feature their workshop, which looks like a far cry from the impressions people have in the backs of their minds of factories in China.<br /><br />Works for iPad cases, but is that only because Apple is a superbrand? I don't think so. I think it could work for almost any product or industry. What about yours?

        ...probably isn't where you've been looking for it.<br /><br />The best "aha!" moments of my life have come from answers to questions that I didn't ask.

But that modus operandi doesn't work 100% of the time, even though my experience has positively reinforced me to keep doing it.

        The Trader Joe's closest to my house offers something very small that makes a big impact: free coffee. If you go in there to shop on any given weekend day (it might be any day, for all I know), there's a caraffe of coffee brewing at the back, and everyone is free to help themselves to a small cup that they can nurse as they wander around the store.<br /><br />There was a Superbowl commercial about 14 years ago that I really liked. A man is being dragged around a department store by his wife when he's suddenly yanked into a rack of blouses. Inside, three men are crouched around a television watching football with a cooler of beer. It's a place to kill time while the wife shops.<br /><br />The coffee reminds me of this. I don't mind going grocery shopping, but it's nice to be able to wander away from my girlfriend, grab a cup, and wander through the aisles with it. It's so nice that it begs that obvious question: why don't other grocery stores do this too?

That's protecting it far more than the car alarm is. And I know that my deadbolt is pretty much worthless. A dedicated cat burglar could bypass it without breaking a sweat. But I know that what I keep in my apartment is not worth very much.<br /><br />Security is all about the incentives involved. Provided the security measure adds enough inconvenience or risk to any would-be attacker, as long as it's greater than the potential payoff, it works.<br /><br />I've known people who don't lock their front doors when they leave their homes. You could call them foolish, but they really just don't think that having to carry around a house key is worth the amount of protection they're getting. They figure if someone wants to get into their home and take some things, then that person will find a way to do it, one way or another. If they don't lock their door, at least they won't have the expense of replacing a broken door or window on top of whatever else was taken.<br /><br />It's not just front doors. Do you secure your home wireless network, for example?<br /><br />Overall, I believe that most people are good, honest, and under normal circumstances, don't pose a threat to me or my own personal security. <br /><br />(P.S. Along these lines, any avid users of FourSquare or Twitter should <a href="http://pleaserobme.com/">have a look at this</a>.)
