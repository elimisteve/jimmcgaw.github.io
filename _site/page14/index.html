        My girlfriend and I spoke to a patent attorney recently regarding some intellectual property. The meeting itself was somewhat costly, but well worth it. I learned about something very interesting: provisional patent applications.<br /><br />(Note: I am NOT a lawyer, especially not a patent one, so none of what follows is legal advice. But I found the information, even just at face value and as a mere possibility, to be useful. For these reasons, I'm sharing it here.)<br /><br />Early on during the meeting, I'm pretty sure the lawyer did some cold reading and made a quick capsule determination about the two of us. In a nutshell, here's what he most likely (and correctly) concluded: "Little to no money." Granted, if that's what he was thinking, he gave absolutely no visible or verbal indication of it. (He was professional about it.)<br /><br />His advice to us: file a provisional patent application.<br /><br />Before 1995, if you wanted patent protection, you had to jump through all of the hoops, and as most people are well aware, the patent process is neither simple nor cheap. It's time consuming, and you have to be very methodical. It's a drag to go through the process and spend the money on an idea, especially an idea that might not be a profitable one.<br /><br />So, about 15 years ago, the US Patent & Trademark Office created the provisional patent. They're relatively easy to prepare (you write one up in plain English, instead of the legalese), you can use photographs of your idea (instead of the patent diagrams, which must be drawn), and it's relatively cheap. ($110 filing fee, at the time I'm writing this.)<br /><br />If you file a provisional patent, a few things happen:<br /><br />1. You get to put "Patent Pending" on your stuff. Even though what you've produced isn't actually protected by an actual patent, this might discourage casual thieves.<br /><br />2. The filing is an official record of when you created your invention. So, if someone else invents your idea next week, your application qualifies as "prior art", which is fancy IP lawyer talk for "they beat you to it".<br /><br />3. You have a grace period of 12 months to file an actual patent, during which time you can test your idea in the marketplace and see if it's actually worth going to the hassle of a full patent.<br /><br />Again: NOT legal advice. I've never done this, so I can't offer my own success story as a precedent for the reason why you should consider doing this. If you've got a great idea and have the money, you should hire a lawyer. I think it even pays to hire one to do the provisional patent for you, because then it's less likely you'll screw something up.<br /><br />But, if you're operating on a shoestring budget, it might be something worth looking into. For general guidance, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1413310729/">this book</a> to be extremely informative. (It's also an extremely readable look into the way that IP lawyers think about intellectual property.)

        "Everyone is already producing anything that anybody could possibly want." This mentality kills the entrepreneur in all of us.<br /><br />"Everyone already has everything they need, or want and can afford." This mentality kills the salesman in all of us.<br /><br />"I'm not confident that I'm right, so I have no place nudging people in any particular direction." This kills the leader in all of us.<br /><br />Out of necessity, we are, at the core of nature, each and every one of these things. And we're each of these mentalities in school because they make it easy to be happy just being "labor".

        "There is no reason for nostalgia. Everything is still happening." -Devin Townsend<br /><br />I've found myself dwelling on the past quite a bit lately. This means one thing, and one thing only: I don't have enough interesting things to occupy my time.

        I was born in 1982, which means that, depending on who you ask, I'm either a very young member of Generation X or an old member of Generation Y. <br /><br />People born around this time are two things (according to people who study these sorts of things):<br /><br />1. Old enough to remember a time before our lives were saturated with the Internet.<br /><br />2. Young enough to be as comfortable using the Internet as a so-called "digital native".<br /><br />On a day-to-day basis, I'm pretty wired in, but I can still remember being in high school and spending hours just staring out the window, doing nothing more than letting my mind run wild. <br /><br />I still make an effort to do this on a regular basis: go stare at the ocean, or take a hike in the mountains. No phone, no computer, no video games, no iPod...just me and my mind.<br /><br />I don't think technology is evil, and I'm skeptical of every "technology is making us stupid" type of argument,  but I do think that the ability to step away from technology and just <em>be</em> (in the zen sense of the word) is still massively beneficial to us.

        According to a <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/05/netflix-traffic/">Wired article</a> this month, Netflix movies streaming across the Internet are now taking up more bandwidth than BitTorrent.<br /><br />This doesn't surprise me. In the large group of people who downloaded music without paying for it, there were very few people I ever met who said they were downloading music because they didn't want to spend money, or because they hated capitalism. On college campuses, Napster just meant you didn't have to haul your butt to the record store to get music. The fact that it was free, and that all of your friends were doing it too, was really just a bonus.<br /><br />The biggest mistake the music industry ever made was not seizing this as an opportunity. Netflix is great, largely because it's easy...much easier than buying a DVD and wading through the previews they still stick at the beginning. People will willingly pay for things when convenience or belonging is a factor.

        I've been listening to the album "Fallen" by Evanescence quite a bit as of late. Honestly, on the whole, the album feels somewhat contrived, but it does have its moments, and it is pretty catchy. I can't say that I'm a huge fan of Amy Lee's voice or lyrics, but there are times on the album when everything comes together and just seems to work.<br /><br />As someone who has tried to record music, I can appreciate music that has decent production, and that's way more than the music. Ten years ago, just recording your music and making it sound good was much harder than it is today. But that doesn't mean that it's actually easy.<br /><br />For me, good music is about a great aesthetic experience that's much, much greater than the sum of its musical parts. On the aforementioned Evanescence album, there's a track called "Hello". At the very beginning of the track, before the piano comes in, there's a brief haunting sound introduces the track. Or on "My Immortal", right after the first time she sings "all of me", there's a few very chilling seconds where the piano is enveloped in an indescribable ambience.<br /><br />Like them or not, these are the things that make good music, and they're not the kind of things you can plan for. You can write all the music you want, but the additional elements that really "make" an album are born of the result of trial and error. You take music into the studio, record some stuff, try putting it together different ways, and test, test test. You see what works and what doesn't. When you happen upon something that evokes the mood you were looking for, it was probably an accident.<br /><br />Music might be technically easy to produce, but it's phenomenally difficult to make interesting. You can't skip the part where you do the sonic experimentation to find what you were looking for...you just have to put in the hours, learning the software and blindly stumbling around. <br /><br />There's a struggle in every worthwhile endeavor. ProTools and GarageBand make music production seem easy. And they do, because it makes serendipitously stumbling upon a unique sound for your music much easier. But those little things still aren't easy to perfect.

        At the turn of the last century, the battle was on to perfect the technology that would power the automobile.<br /><br />A few different means of powering cars were attempted. Naturally, gas-powered engines were one of them. Amongst them, though, was an electric car and even a car powered by a steam engine. (Early inventors seemed to regard cars as "little trains".)<br /><br />The electric car didn't take off because, at the time, a battery that could fit into a car couldn't hold a charge to travel great distances. And steam engines were too large and bulky to work in an automobile targeted at the average consumer. By process of elimination, Henry Ford started mass producing cars that ran on gasoline.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this is that there was no central authority that reached this conclusion. No one sat down around a conference table and made a decision. No one weighed the pros and cons of each particular idea against one another and then used that information to arrive at a logical conclusion. What happened simply happened, as a part of the gradual process of the rising demand for automobiles. And the results of this process have struck around for more than a century.<br /><br />What happens next in the realm of automobile propulsion will probably be based the same messy, inexact, mysterious process of the market moving slowly over the next ten years.

        Blogger appears to be having problems. The entries for the last few days didn't get published as hoped and a few I had stowed up got deleted.<br /><br />Problem? Maybe...<br /><br />If you talk to someone who works in the video game industry, they'll tell you that Angry Birds is not that challenging of a game to make. It has its strengths, like the cutesy graphics and sound effects, and it tells a story, but from a strictly technical perspective, it's not that tricky of a game to create. They just used an out-of-the-box physics engine and game framework and have enjoyed runaway success, while some developers who are busy rolling their own physics libraries have yet to see a single dime of revenue.<br /><br />I imagine there are chefs running restaurants preparing excellent food who wonder why on earth people settle for Subway and won't spend the extra $8 a person to eat his great food.<br /><br />An author pours her heart and soul into writing a book that perfectly mirrors the human condition, but nobody buys it because they're busy scooping up the last volume of Harry Potter, which J.K.Rowling didn't seem to put any effort into writing or promoting. How unfair.<br /><br />To the frustrated professional, the market looks broken, because people are supposed to act a certain way, in a <em>rational</em> fashion. And most of us that produce work that doesn't attain a massive following have brains that trick us into thinking that rational people would buy what <em>we're</em> producing, instead of something else. (The ego says, "I'm the best choice.")<br /><br />If you want that job, or want to make a video game, or want to write a book, maybe you should accept that the market is broken and work to fill in the cracks. It's a waste of time and effort to try to fix it.

        One of the factors considered in whether or not an invention or an idea is patentable is the concept of <em>non-obviousness</em>. That is, could someone in your profession have conceived of the same idea or been able to solve the problem without a lot of thought?<br /><br />I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not terribly interested in dwelling on legal matters, but I like the implications that the term "non-obvious" belies. I think that good ideas are always out in the open, but no one's found them because no one's gone looking for them.<br /><br />Some obvious ideas:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A mobile app for passengers for commercial airline flight tracking.</li><br /><li>A retail store that sells sports apparel for big-league teams.</li><br /><li>A coffee or cupcake shop.</li><br /><li>A New Age store that holds Yoga classes in the evenings.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Some (maybe) not-so-obvious ideas (ignoring any implications for patent-ability):<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A device that helps senior citizens manage their daily medications.</li><br /><li>A [something]-gram that could be sent to men.

Make it something different.)</li><br /><li>A coffee or cupcake shop which, by design, accommodates people with all major allergies or other dietary restrictions.</li><br /><li>Software for a golf course that helps manage caddies.
