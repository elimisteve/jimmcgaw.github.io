        If you're driving a motorcycle, in most states, it's illegal to ride on the dividing line between lanes, a practice which is called "lane splitting". Here in California, however, that's perfectly legal. It's happened more than one that I'm driving on the highway in heavy traffic and suddenly, without warning, a motorcycle zips between me and the car in the lane next to me.<br /><br />I come from Michigan, where this was not a legal way to drive a motorcycle, so it seems dangerous. My gut reaction is to believe that permitting this makes drivers on the road less safe, and that it would result in an increase of fatalities on the highways. Not all motorcycle drivers do it, but enough do that it's gotten my attention. I haven't gathered the data on fatalities to give you an official report, because the dangers of lane splitting are not what I'm curious about.<br /><br />What if, ignoring the risks, you suddenly made lane splitting legal in Michigan, a state that doesn't currently permit it? Would lots of motorcyclists sudden take the opportunity to go out lane splitting just because they're suddenly allowed to, or would most of them not do it just because their first reaction will be similar to mine: that driving this was just doesn't seem safe?<br /><br />Even given hard data and statistics, people are going to react emotionally. I wonder how much of this instilled sense of what is safe to do and what we're afraid to do is driven by what the government has sanctioned as legal? The voice of the people is supposed to drive public policy, but to what extent is the voice of the people just parroting what our body of laws tells us?

        A month ago, on Facebook, I posted a link to the following page:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rpmchallenge.com/content/view/844/1/">The RPM Challenge</a><br /><br />Don't worry if you don't feel like clicking through and reading that. It basically challenges anyone with any musical ability to write and record an album of new material in the month of February. Write and record 10 songs in 28 days.<br /><br />I liked this idea, and I did it. (I invite any of my friends to listen to the songs on my Facebook profile under "My Band" if you're interested.) Why did I do this? The article in the link above says it best: because I could. No better reason.<br /><br />I was pretty sure the songs wouldn't be the pinnacle of my art. It's not that I resolved to write <em>bad</em> songs. It's just that I decided not to let the fact that they wouldn't be <em>great</em> songs deter me from following through on the whole thing.<br /><br />Steve Jobs actually said this much more succinctly to a coder at Apple: "Real artists ship."<br /><br />Perfection is the enemy of getting it done. The drive to be perfect is useful and productive in its own right, but it's all too easy to let it feed you an endless list of excuses to avoid <em>shipping</em>. That mentality might not get you to Carnegie Hall, as the old joke goes, but it will move you forward.

        So, you've been meaning to get around to recording that song, or writing that book, or designing and selling that T-shirt, or painting that abstract self-portrait for the ages. I'm sure there are lots of reasons, but is one of them because you're slightly afraid?<br /><br />It's scary to put your art out there for everyone to see, judge, critique, and so on, because, by extension, they're judging <em>you</em>. That's a scary thing to face. Even just thinking about it makes me cringe.<br /><br />The value in what you create lies in that very fear. The value of your art stems from the fact that, in producing it, you've overcome the fear that kept you from creating it in the first place. If it were easy, more people would do it. Scarcity creates value, and since so few people make the leap to overcome their own fear, you have the opportunity to create something really valuable.<br /><br />It takes guts to speak in your own voice, ignoring the devil on your shoulder, and that is a big part of what makes others admire it.

        I'm not a huge watcher of reality television, but each show tends to have a niche audience.  If I'm going to watch them, I prefer those that require the contestants to create something each week. I don't watch it, but take the premise behind the show "Project Runway": it gives fashion designers a challenge each week to create something a specific realm of fashion. A panel of judges later evaluates what they did and they decide upon a winner and loser. Another show called "Hell's Kitchen" evaluates contestants based not only on how good the food they prepare is, but by how well they manage a team of cooks in a kitchen.<br /><br />For no particular reason except to brainstorm, here are some ideas for themes that could be used for reality television shows. Like the examples above, the ideas are designed to reward those who are more creative, and/or can execute plans well.<br /><br />(If any of these already exist, my bad. Again, I don't watch a lot of TV.)<br /><br />1. Music - each week, the musicians are given a challenge about a song they have to compose. Genres range from commercial jingles to pop songs. They're rated and eliminated based on the results.<br /><br />2. User interface design - Give user interface experts/software developers a challenge each week and if they can create something usable by ordinary human beings. We all bitch about how Microsoft Office keeps changing and no one can find their favorite commands in the menus anymore, so this might actually have mainstream appeal.<br /><br />3. Helping the Homeless - give people with very few resources in the US a challenge to help homeless people in creative and new ways.<br /><br />4. Environmentalism - focusing on a single community each week, have contestants come up with ways to tackle environmental issues affecting the area.<br /><br />5. Urban planning - Again, pick a new city each week, and give contestants a problem they have to solve.<br /><br />6. Advertising - each week, young advertisers are given a consumer product for which they have to create an ad campaign. (There's product placement potential here, why has no one done this yet?)<br /><br />I realize that a few of these ideas have convergent solutions, meaning it's likely that more than one contestant might arrive at the same solution. In those cases, differentiate and judge them based on their attention to detail.<br /><br />Reality television is very passive in its offerings, and that might be because of the audience to which it's supposed to cater. But it also has the ability to make people say "Hey, I could do that! Why don't I?" Think of the inspiration that "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" offers to viewers each week.<br /><br />Got any ideas of your own?

        There's a widely held and unhelpful belief that the world around us is static. We attribute the way our civilization is to a series of decisions made by people who came before us, who had more authority, and who faced more urgent problems that demanded solving.<br /><br />That worldview is, of course, completely wrong. It's not just wrong, it's hopelessly wrong, and if you see things that way, you need to rub your eyes and take another look.<br /><br />Civilization is not evidence of stagnation. It may seem like a static beast that is difficult and slow to change, and you're right, but changing it is <em>not</em> impossible. If everyone looked at the world and concluded "Well, this is it", then modern civilization wouldn't exist as we know it. We'd still be running through the woods, living in caves, and eating, um, I dunno, <em>fish</em>, or whatever it is we used to eat before the modern economy ramped up. (I never went to Anthropology class.)<br /><br />People before us were just like we are: surrounded by lots of people who believed that nothing would change the world. The people we know by name, the icons, the ones in the history books, they're the ones who ignored that "fact" and the people around them who tried to proliferate the unhelpful message of futility.<br /><br />Everything around you is evidence of mankind's <em>capacity</em> for change, not his resistance to it.

        On a recent flight from Detroit to Los Angeles, I sat next to a girl who was reading a book about how to write. I asked her if she was a writer, and we struck up a conversation about that for a little while. Among other things, she shared an interesting idea with me that an author had once given her.<br /><br />It went: "There's no such thing as writer's block. Writer's just have two modes: input and output. If you're not writing, it's not because you can't write, it's because you're in 'input' mode."<br /><br />That's an interesting idea, but I think it's incomplete. There's a step between input and output when you're processing what you've taken in, before you can generate your own thoughts and express your own ideas about it. <br /><br />I try to be creative in a few different ways, one of which is in writing. Near as I can figure, there are four parts to this process:<br /><br />1. Reading the ideas of others. (input)<br />2. Digesting what I've read. (processing)<br />3. Writing down my ideas. (output)<br />4. Studying vocabulary. (mechanics)<br /><br />The last step isn't really part of the flow, but it can be critical to getting better at whatever you're doing. It's the part of school that we all hated. It's rote learning. It's memorization. It sucks but I think you have to spend some of your time doing it. (It's a good way to kill time while you're processing.)<br /><br />I play the guitar and write music. The same four things apply:<br /><br />1. Listening to the music of others. (input)<br />2. Digesting what I've heard. (processing)<br />3. Recording the music. (output)<br />4. Practice the instrument. (mechanics)<br /><br />Inevitably, whatever I create is influenced by what I've observed and absorbed in the past. There's no getting around it. It's not that I'm trying to rip other people off and steal what they've done, but the "processing" step is very mysterious. Stuff goes in and new stuff comes out, and it's usually difficult to find direct ties between one and the other.<br /><br />I think we can spend time learning the fourth part (mechanics), and that's where practice helps you. But the real value in what you produce comes from the second part (processing). It's the black box in your head that's responsible for what spews forth when you sit down to create. That's what makes what you create your own, with your own style and voice.<br /><br />Ultimately, you need to allocate time to each of the four factors, and strike a comfortable balance between them. But the most important one is #3. Without that, you never end up sharing your potential with anyone else.

        Think about what you studied in college, or, if you didn't go to college, the industry in which you currently work. I'm going to assume, like most academic fields, that's it probably very boring. It might be technical, business-related, or maybe one of the social sciences.<br /><br />Here's my question: would it be possible for you to write a book or start a blog that made the topic interesting not only to people working within the field, but also to a more mainstream audience?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> is an author and blogger in the computer security industry, but a lot of what he writes would be of interest not only to security professionals but to the general public, simply because he writes like a human being, about daily things that most people deal with. He offers his take on airline security, identity theft, privacy issues, and the dangers of computerizing political elections.<br /><br />Before he came along, imagine being challenged to make "security and technology" interesting to a more mainstream audience. Not an easy task. Like most academic fields, it's full of people trying to talk very technical in a way that makes themselves sound smart, and a lot of them are just parroting the conventional wisdom to people in the same field.<br /><br />The result? A field of white roses. White roses are nice, to be certain, but people don't find them interesting. They don't send them to one another on Valentine's Day. They don't exude passion, just banality. They're ordinary.<br /><br />So, the challenge is to paint the roses red. Make them vibrant and interesting so people start to take note. If you do a search for "computer security" on Amazon.com, you don't get Bruce Schneier's books. Instead, you get a lot of textbooks that are all dryly telling computer people the technical details behind securing servers, blah blah. You'd have to dig for a while and ask around before you found Bruce.<br /><br />I see some people in the audience are still not convinced...all right, let me try this for myself. I studied Accounting in college, and that's what I have a Bachelor's degree in. As far as I know, the field of Accounting doesn't have any superstars that write stuff that would interest anyone who isn't an accountant. Does that mean it can't be done? I doubt it. It's all in the presentation.<br /><br />Now, it might be challenging to make accounting interesting to people who aren't in business, so let's just focus on managers and CEOs that have to learn Accounting, and grind their teeth as they wade through "Bookkeeping for Dummies" or whatever. How can we engage them?<br /><br />Most people who learned I was an Accounting major ask for help with their taxes. "Accounting" doesn't equal "Tax Returns", but it's a common myth, so let's start there. Break this book on tax breaks into three sections: individuals, small business owners, and corporations. Find the common tax breaks for each, and list them. There are tons of books about what deductions are available. But my guess is that the majority of people and business owners are going to take advantage of a very small few of them. (it's the Pareto Principle) So, let's cut out the ones that hardly anyone takes advantage of.<br /><br />First, people read stories. It's how the brain comprehends the world around it. We tell ourselves little stories, and make up little narratives in our heads, to make sense of our lives and the people we interact with. So, step one is to back up <em>everything</em> we say, <em>every</em> point we make, with a story from the real world. Make it human. Describe a problem someone was facing, possibly in crisis mode, and talk about how the tax break helped them.<br /><br />You get the idea. It wouldn't be super easy, but it could be done. Why don't I do this, you ask? Because I don't work at H&R Freakin' Block, that's why. I don't even work as an accountant anymore. It would waaaayyyy too much trouble for me to find the stories required to make this sort of thing interesting.<br /><br />The Accounting section at your local Borders is filled with white roses. It would be helpful, especially in the wake of the Enron scandals, if someone could write a more mainstream book that helps people understand just how corporate fraud works. I know someone wrote a book about Enron, but it's 500 pages long and is mostly irrelevant narrative that even I, as an accountant, thought was tedious. <br /><br />The real reason we should try to paint the roses red is because things like Enron confuse and worry people. It makes them want to comprehend the world around them. They want to understand. People just don't want to be bored to death while you're explaining it to them. That's the challenge.

        We're told to listen to make sure we don't miss it when opportunity knocks on our door. The implication, then, is that we should sit idly by and wait for opportunity to come to us. <br /><br />That's not entirely a bad thing, because some days, we just need to relax and passively dream. I've had plenty of Sundays where I sat around, wishing the opportunity to be a part of something would present itself to me, and (big reveal!) it didn't, and I just ended up going to sleep that evening, having gotten nowhere.<br /><br />There are lots of people sitting around, waiting for opportunity to knock on their doors. This sounds like an opportunity in and of itself. Given the Internet's capacity to help you organize and mobilize large groups, here's the big question: where would you lead all of those people if you asked them to follow you, and a bunch of them said yes?<br /><br />Given the right opportunity, there are lots of people ready to follow you. Ready to lead? Figure out where you want to go, and then get out and go knocking.

        A lot of us don't try very hard to make a positive impact on those around us because we don't believe that we hold positions of influence. Let's face it: most of us are not movie stars or very rich.<br /><br />The problem with the Six Degrees of Separation theory is the name. It's actually the Six Degrees of <em>Connection</em>. Think about it. Six degrees of influence, of expressing respect or gratitude, of demonstrating humanity. It means we're, at most, six connections away from someone who's widely respected, or from a person who has influence and is actually in a position to inspire lots of people.<br /><br />Think about the person in this country who inspires you the most. The implication is that you're no more than six connections away from them. That means you have a pretty good chance of returning the favor via your acquaintances or even casual interactions with random strangers, albeit in an indirect way, and without getting credit for it.<br /><br />What you do and how you do it matter a great deal.

      <div class="content">
        Shortly after graduating from college, I got a rather unexpected call from an acquaintance with whom I went to high school and attended college. (We were both business majors, so we shared a few classes.) After some small talk and kicking around the idea of meeting up for a beer one night, I found myself wondering why he was bothering to call me. We hadn't spoken much in college, and weren't particularly good friends. Why the sudden interest in what I was doing?<br /><br />That was when he mentioned that he was now working at a company where he was in training to be a financial planner. Tactfully, he slipped in a request that I come over to visit him one evening so he and his associates at the company could make a pitch so I might be convinced to let them handle my finances. Ah...now I get it.<br /><br />Here's the problem: if you treat me like a prospect, then I'm going to treat you like a salesman. Actually, I'm going to treat you worse than a salesman, because usually, when I'm talking to a salesman, it's because I've sought them out for something I need. Getting a call from a friend/acquaintance/family member who is trying to sell you something is an <em>egregious</em> violation of trust. It makes you seem more promiscuous and it ruins our relationship by turning it into more of a transaction than a real connection.<br /><br />Facebook is full of people trying to promote things. I'm not against that in and of itself, but I think there's a line that needs to be drawn. Take this blog, for example, which I recently started feeding into my Facebook account so friends would see my posts in their news feeds. I don't have any ads on here, and I never will. I'm here to offer any advice and ideas to anyone that might be interested, not turn it into a profit center.
