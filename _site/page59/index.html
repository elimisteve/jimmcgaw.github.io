                      If you're driving a motorcycle, in most states, it's illegal to ride on the dividing line between lanes, a practice which is called "lane splitting". Here in California, however, that's perfectly legal. It's happened more than one that I'm driving on the highway in heavy traffic and suddenly, without warning, a motorcycle zips between me and the car in the lane next to me.I come from Michigan, where this was not a legal way to...

                      So, you've been meaning to get around to recording that song, or writing that book, or designing and selling that T-shirt, or painting that abstract self-portrait for the ages. I'm sure there are lots of reasons, but is one of them because you're slightly afraid?It's scary to put your art out there for everyone to see, judge, critique, and so on, because, by extension, they're judging you. That's a scary thing to face. Even just...

                      I'm not a huge watcher of reality television, but each show tends to have a niche audience. If I'm going to watch them, I prefer those that require the contestants to create something each week. I don't watch it, but take the premise behind the show "Project Runway": it gives fashion designers a challenge each week to create something a specific realm of fashion. A panel of judges later evaluates what they did and they...

                      There's a widely held and unhelpful belief that the world around us is static. We attribute the way our civilization is to a series of decisions made by people who came before us, who had more authority, and who faced more urgent problems that demanded solving.That worldview is, of course, completely wrong. It's not just wrong, it's hopelessly wrong, and if you see things that way, you need to rub your eyes and take another...

                      On a recent flight from Detroit to Los Angeles, I sat next to a girl who was reading a book about how to write. I asked her if she was a writer, and we struck up a conversation about that for a little while. Among other things, she shared an interesting idea with me that an author had once given her.It went: "There's no such thing as writer's block. Writer's just have two modes: input...

                      Think about what you studied in college, or, if you didn't go to college, the industry in which you currently work. I'm going to assume, like most academic fields, that's it probably very boring. It might be technical, business-related, or maybe one of the social sciences.Here's my question: would it be possible for you to write a book or start a blog that made the topic interesting not only to people working within the field,...

                      We're told to listen to make sure we don't miss it when opportunity knocks on our door. The implication, then, is that we should sit idly by and wait for opportunity to come to us. That's not entirely a bad thing, because some days, we just need to relax and passively dream. I've had plenty of Sundays where I sat around, wishing the opportunity to be a part of something would present itself to me,...

                      A lot of us don't try very hard to make a positive impact on those around us because we don't believe that we hold positions of influence. Let's face it: most of us are not movie stars or very rich.The problem with the Six Degrees of Separation theory is the name. It's actually the Six Degrees of Connection. Think about it. Six degrees of influence, of expressing respect or gratitude, of demonstrating humanity. It means...

                      Shortly after graduating from college, I got a rather unexpected call from an acquaintance with whom I went to high school and attended college. (We were both business majors, so we shared a few classes.) After some small talk and kicking around the idea of meeting up for a beer one night, I found myself wondering why he was bothering to call me. We hadn't spoken much in college, and weren't particularly good friends. Why...
