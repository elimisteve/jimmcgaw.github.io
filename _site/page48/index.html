                      There's a local band in my town that plays Peruvian jazz. In truth Peruvian style, the guitar player always plays the pan flute instead of a harmonica. He's accompanied by a percussionist on conga drums and a saxophonist. They are an excellent group, and if they're playing in town, I'll go watch them perform when I've got a free evening. At their shows, there's always a video camera set up on a tripod, recording them....

                      I had an old high school chum message me a few weeks ago. He mentioned that he had been unemployed for the last few months and was looking for work in the culinary arts.A few days after we spoke, he found himself a job, at which he seems to be very happy. He didn't ask me for my advice about job hunting (and I don't think he would have needed it), but if he had,...

                      One of my co-workers gave me an excellent piece of advice: "Never be a journalist; be a specialist." This is excellent advice that doesn't just pertain to the field of journalism. It's actually very common advice in business wisdom that you shouldn't try to be all things to all people, because that does very little to distinguish you.We grew up consuming mass marketing, listening to car companies and Coca-Cola using classic rock in boring commercials...

                      I had a friend who went in for a job interview recently. She interviewed with the owner of a very small, high-end retail shop. He wanted help expanding his business, particularly the online portion being run through his store's website.He concluded the interview by telling her, "Whoever I hire to do this job, I want them to be willing to work very hard. As hard as it takes to get the job done. This business...

                      Last year, the day after Thanksgiving, I went into Best Buy to purchase a computer that I had read about in the sales flyers. I knew that I needed a new laptop for work, and there was a pretty good deal on a Toshiba. I'm not overzealous about these kinds of sales, so I slept in, and went into the store around 11 A.M.The first employee I asked about the computer told me that he...

                      In an era when I can go online and pay a relatively small fee to file my individual income taxes using TurboTax, why would I go to H&R Block or hire an accountant? Ask a tax accountant this question, and they'll probably get very defensive. Either that, or grumble something about how working with a person is better than working with an online software service. So far, they haven't convinced me of the latter point.I...

                      I once read somewhere that you should be cautious with your use of the word "obviously". If something really is obvious, then pointing it out is redundant. If it isn't, then it's diminutive to the person you're talking to.A lot of what I write on here is probably stating the obvious to someone. It's very presumptuous of me to write these little bursts of my thoughts and expect anyone to get something out of them....

                      I remember reading an interview with Kurt Cobain many years ago in which he lamented the use of music by most teenagers as a means of determining who their friends would be, or using their friends in order to determine what music they should be listening to. He felt that the music an individual chose to listen to should be a reflection of them as a person. Music as art is "I", not "we", in...

                      The economy of the town I live in is driven primarily by tourism. That means that along the main street, there are a bunch of little shops selling T-shirts and other SWAG that's embossed with the name of the city. There's lots of little items that are supposed to remind you of the time you came to visit our little beach town. They're selling souvenirs.As I was walking down main street yesterday, I passed a...

                      Before we embark on new ventures or commit to new fields too heavily, we ask: "Is there a future in that?" Naturally, you want to make sure what you're doing is worth the time and effort that you're going to be putting into it.A different question you should ask yourself might be: "Is there a past in that?" More specifically, is any of your past in the project? Ask yourself if you're doing this for...
