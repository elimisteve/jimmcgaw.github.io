        I had an old high school chum message me a few weeks ago. He mentioned that he had been unemployed for the last few months and was looking for work in the culinary arts.<br /><br />A few days after we spoke, he found himself a job, at which he seems to be very happy. He didn't ask me for my advice about job hunting (and I don't think he would have needed it), but if he had, here's what I would have told him to do (remember, he was looking for work as a chef, so the advice is specific to him):<br /><br />1. Start making every meal at home. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Anything you want, but don't go out to eat.<br /><br />2. Prepare something different each night. Whatever you want to make, but once it's finished, it has to look good.<br /><br />3. Get a digital camera and take a picture of each finished meal before you devour it.<br /><br />4. Write up a brief description of why you chose to make the meal you did. It doesn't have to be a novel, but details help. Why did you choose to mix the ingredients you did? What difficulties did you encounter? Did you have to improvise any detail?<br /><br />5. Once you have several dozen examples, to <a href="http://www.blurb.com/">Blurb.com</a> and turn your photographs and descriptions of your efforts into a picture book. Put your name, contact info, and the most mouthwatering picture you have on the cover. Order as many copies as you think you'll need and, whenever a prospective client or employer asks you for your business card, give them the book.<br /><br />If you want the photos to look good, you'll need way more advice than I can give you...but to get you started, make sure that your white balance is properly set, learn about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>, and for those up-close shots, experiment with your camera's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">depth of field</a>.<br /><br />You might not be a chef, but this could help you make an impression at your next job interview. That goes triple if you happen to be a proctologist.

        One of my co-workers gave me an excellent piece of advice: "Never be a journalist; be a specialist." This is excellent advice that doesn't just pertain to the field of journalism. It's actually very common advice in business wisdom that you shouldn't try to be all things to all people, because that does very little to distinguish you.<br /><br />We grew up consuming mass marketing, listening to car companies and Coca-Cola using classic rock in boring commercials to sell us stuff. So, we're all under the impression that the most effective communication is to create a generic message about ourselves on our resumes and email it to as many people as we possibly can, in the hopes that one of them will get noticed by someone who wants to interview and ultimately hire us.<br /><br />Think about it from the employer's perspective...the employer out there who really needs <em>you</em>, and would happily pay you to do what you excel at doing. If you write your resume to speak to that small handful of employers, then you just might pop off the page the next time HR is thumbing through a stack of resumes and cover letters that are all made of ticky-tacky.

        I had a friend who went in for a job interview recently. She interviewed with the owner of a very small, high-end retail shop. He wanted help expanding his business, particularly the online portion being run through his store's website.<br /><br />He concluded the interview by telling her, "Whoever I hire to do this job, I want them to be willing to work very hard. As hard as it takes to get the job done. This business is like my child...I want to expand its reach and grow it. Whoever I hire has to be willing to do whatever it takes."<br /><br />Ignoring how broad the phrase "whatever it takes" is, there's a problem with trying to hire an employee to work for you and expecting that they'll work with the same passion that an owner would. Entrepreneurs are tireless workers, but they choose to do what they do because they're often in the game for more than the paycheck.<br /><br />If you bring someone into your business to work for you, you can't expect them to act like a partner and put in 120% just because you desperately want them to. You have two options in this case:<br /><br />1. Give them equity in your business, which (theoretically) will incentivize them to grow the business with you, so they have some hopes of eventually cashing in on all their extra input.<br /><br />2. Make them believe in what you're doing. If you're a non-profit supporting an important cause, you might be able to attract people willing to put in extra effort for no extra money because they truly believe in what you're doing. (In my friend's case, a high-end retail shop didn't meet these criteria.)<br /><br />Failing these two things, the only other chance you might have is finding someone who needs the work desperately enough to earn the paycheck. But secretly, they're going to hate you for it, and as soon as they find a better opportunity, they're going to leave.

        Last year, the day after Thanksgiving, I went into Best Buy to purchase a computer that I had read about in the sales flyers. I knew that I needed a new laptop for work, and there was a pretty good deal on a Toshiba. I'm not overzealous about these kinds of sales, so I slept in, and went into the store around 11 A.M.<br /><br />The first employee I asked about the computer told me that he didn't think they carried that particular computer, but he wasn't certain about that. The next employee I asked told me that they had sold out of that particular computer I had seen the flyer, but that there was another, virtually identical laptop she could give me that was $100 more, and came with a printer and carrying case. I was anxious for a new computer, and I had been planning to buy a carrying case too, so I quickly warmed up to the idea.<br /><br />It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_and_switch">Bait and Switch</a>. It's an old sales tactic that lures in customers with the promise of a cheap product offering, but when the customer asks for it, it's unavailable for some reason, but a higher-priced substitute is.<br /><br />I had heard of the Bait and Switch tactic long before I went into Best Buy that Black Friday, but when the employee told me, without missing a beat, "Hey, we have an alternative laptop you can buy", the thought that I was being manipulated did not cross my mind.<br /><br />Later, it dawned on me that it was a possibility. I Googled "Best Buy Bait and Switch" and quickly found lots of people sharing similar stories. (Google Suggest even offered "best buy bait and switch black friday 2009" before I was even finished typing my query into the search engine.) The stories came from people who were frustrated because they were lured into the store with false promises and were then upsold on a more expensive product...very similar to my experience.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I'm happy with the computer. That's really not the issue. I keep it around for some programming projects and to record my music on. But whenever I'm sitting there, waiting for it to boot up, I can't help but remember where it came from. I remember being manipulated, I remember being made into a sucker, and I don't like myself for it. I don't like Best Buy for it.<br /><br />I'm sure some of my friends (the Libertarian ones) will tell me that it's nobody's fault but my own. <em>Caveat emptor</em>, the old mantra goes. I should have been thinking and should have realized what was happening at the time. And they're partly right. But in the case where Best Buy "tricks" a customer into buying a computer, under those circumstances, how is that person <em>supposed</em> to feel when they find out?<br /><br />It's not smart. I used to make a habit of going to Best Buy, just for the hell of it, whenever I passed by their store. Often, I would buy something. Now, I never bother going there. And if I need to buy something, I try and go to Best Buy as an absolute last resort. Nobody wins in these cases: I lost a place to browse electronics and DVDs, and they lost the lifetime value of me being a customer. I wouldn't tell anyone they should go to Best Buy now. <br /><br />Manipulation leads to transactions, not relationships, and long-term successful business strategy is based on the latter.

        In an era when I can go online and pay a relatively small fee to file my individual income taxes using TurboTax, why would I go to H&R Block or hire an accountant? Ask a tax accountant this question, and they'll probably get very defensive. Either that, or grumble something about how working with a person is better than working with an online software service. So far, they haven't convinced me of the latter point.<br /><br />I remember visiting Henry Ford Museum in Detroit when I was very young, and there was an exhibit of a robot arm painting car doors. First came the assembly line, which was people specializing in a given area of production. Several decades later, lots of those people were replaced by machines. I wondered: how did that make the people who used to do the painting feel? To have been replaced by a <em>machine</em>?<br /><br />Here's a more personally relevant question: as a computer programmer, why would anyone hire me to work for them when they can get the same job done for cheaper by outsourcing the work to India?<br /><br />These are uncomfortable questions. Most people just avoid asking them or thinking about what the answer might be. This is because there is no easy answer to them. And coming up without an answer is a scary proposition, because it's a little like looking yourself in the mirror at 50 years old and accepting that you're not young anymore.<br /><br />There may not be a fountain of youth, but you can control what you know and what you're capable of. Find the answers to the uncomfortable questions, then broadcast them loud and proud.

        I once read somewhere that you should be cautious with your use of the word "obviously". If something really is obvious, then pointing it out is redundant. If it isn't, then it's diminutive to the person you're talking to.<br /><br />A lot of what I write on here is probably stating the obvious to someone. It's very presumptuous of me to write these little bursts of my thoughts and expect anyone to get something out of them. My thoughts on that: if you read something on here and the point I make it obvious to you, then it wasn't meant for you. <br /><br />There are very few new ideas being generated amongst writers. Ergo, everything is obvious to <em>someone</em>. If you start the process of ideation with the presumption that what you're saying has to be meaningful and insightful to everyone, you'll end up saying very little, if anything.<br /><br />Obviously.

        I remember reading an interview with Kurt Cobain many years ago in which he lamented the use of music by most teenagers as a means of determining who their friends would be, or using their friends in order to determine what music they should be listening to. He felt that the music an individual chose to listen to should be a reflection of them as a person. Music as art is "I", not "we", in other words.<br /><br />I agreed with him when I read it, back in 1998. Similar to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in <em>Almost Famous</em> insisting that real rock 'n' roll lives in your car, in your room at home. It's what you're passionate about, and it doesn't matter if it's popular or gets played on the radio.<br /><br />But where does scarcity lie now? Over the course of the twentieth century, technology changed how people perceived and listened to music. It shifted the scarcity several times, in different ways.<br /><br />In the beginning, you had to be there in order to hear the musician perform live. If you didn't have someone with the chops to play what you wanted, or you couldn't attend in person, you were out of luck. (That must have made people appreciate music a little more.)<br /><br />Then someone conceived of a way of recording audio and a means of playing it back later. Thus a market was created for audio devices and recorded music.<br /><br />Later, the radio came along. Suddenly, a live performance or a recording could be broadcast to tens of thousands of people at the same time. The audience wasn't limited to the number of people that could huddle around a guy at a piano or the capacity of a concert hall. Intelligent artists embraced this as the ultimate mass marketing machine, and that's where we were until about ten years ago.<br /><br />Then, the Internet, with its Napster, then iTunes, and now Amazon MP3 downloads.  <br /><br />If you think about the evolution of music, both in terms of the technologies associated with recording and listening to it, and the means of distribution, music has evolved significantly over the past century. Each time, the scarcity shifted in different ways.<br /><br />Now, digital music is everywhere. We have access to all kinds of music, via MySpace and sites like GrooveShark, where you can go listen to almost anything you want without limit. We have in on our phones and iPods, in our cars, and in our favorite retail stores playing overhead. Music is ubiquitous, and we can choose to listen to whatever we just about whenever we want.<br /><br />These days, what's scarce about it?<br /><br />If you happen to be in a band or are a musician with a CD you want to sell, you need to answer that question: what are you giving people? They have lots of choices; why should anyone listen to your CD? What's special about it? Where's the scarcity?<br /><br />As human beings living in the United States, we're probably short on interactions with other people. While music has become a viable commodity, we used Walkmans and now iPods to shut ourselves off from other people. People seem to walk around craving meaningful conversation and relationships with other people. That's the scarce luxury we seek, while music has become a commodity. It makes sense, then, that people would start to choose the music they listen to based on its ability to help them connect with other people. <br /><br />What are the Joneses listening to? We can't help but ask and start listening ourselves. If you're a band, this is what you need to give your fans if you want to amass a following. (And while you're at it, please learn how to play your instruments.)<br /><br />If he were alive today, Kurt would probably hate this. But then again, he doesn't strike me as a very cheerful person.

        The economy of the town I live in is driven primarily by tourism. That means that along the main street, there are a bunch of little shops selling T-shirts and other SWAG that's embossed with the name of the city. There's lots of little items that are supposed to remind you of the time you came to visit our little beach town. They're selling souvenirs.<br /><br />As I was walking down main street yesterday, I passed a little music store that deals in new and used CDs and LPs. I don't often go in there, since I have little use for CDs, but on this particular day, I went in. And as walked around among the racks of CDs and LPs, I started to see the CDs the same way as the LPs.<br /><br />If you're my age (around 30), then you may have gotten introduced to records in the same way I did: your parent's old collection. In the house where I grew up, my parents had a big shelf full of records, a relic of a by-gone era. They still had a few working record players, so I was able to listen to them. Call it being a passive, uncreative MC.<br /><br />In visiting a few friends recently, I noticed that those CD towers loaded with jewel cases had gone the same route. They now sit in a corner or spare bedroom, largely neglected and collecting dust. They've become a relic, much like LPs were ten or twenty years ago.<br /><br />Pointing out that CDs are outmoded is not much of an insight, but what surprises me is that nothing has taken their place. Granted, digital music works fine for me, but there's a reason that e-commerce is still a very small portion of overall retail sales: we still want to do our shopping in person. Going out and buying physical copies of music is still important to us. If the music store selling CDs and LPs were just selling souvenirs, they might have a very difficult time staying in business.<br /><br />I wonder exactly why the music industry hasn't starting selling jump drive loaded with albums. Whenever most people buy a CD, the first thing they do is run home and rip it onto their computer, so they have it backed up in MP3 format. Why not cut out this middleman and just sell hard copies of DRM-free, digital music? I used to love buying CDs because I felt like I was purchasing joy in a jewel case...you could still deliver that joy on a jump drive.<br /><br />Digital music and the retail experience are not mutually exclusive. People will continue to buy music in places other than Amazon. It's been ten years since Napster came onto the scene...why hasn't the music industry caught on yet?

        Before we embark on new ventures or commit to new fields too heavily, we ask: "Is there a future in that?" Naturally, you want to make sure what you're doing is worth the time and effort that you're going to be putting into it.<br /><br />A different question you should ask yourself might be: "Is there a past in that?" More specifically, is any of <em>your</em> past in the project? Ask yourself if you're doing this for any of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. You're personally vested in the idea. (even though its shelf life may have expired)<br />2. Out of habit<br />3. You're doing it strictly to compete with someone else<br />4. You're on a revenge kick to get even with someone<br /><br />If you are, it might be time to stop and start over. There's lot of good reasons to follow through on stuff. But if what you're doing is too much mired into who you were five years ago or an idea you had when you were that person, it might be wise to let go of it.

        One of the hardest parts of running any business is finding new customers. It's a matter of getting your message to the right people. Timing is important, too. If you're running a pizza parlor, you can probably run ads on local television stations around dinner time, flash a phone number on the screen, and, provided the pizza itself is bearable, you'll probably do pretty well for yourself.<br /><br />There's probably potential for small businesses to do this kind of thing at local used bookstores. If you're a personal trainer, sponsor the Health & Fitness section. If you're a personal chef or a nutritionist, sponsor the Cooking section. If you're an Herbalist or Reflexologist or something that's otherwise pretty new-agey, sponsor the New Age section. <br /><br />Spend the money to pay the purveyor of the bookstore a monthly fee, print up a good-looking sign to hang from the shelves, and put a bookmark with the same graphics/colors as the sign in each book. (Keeping the visuals consistent creates a trail from the bookstore shelves to the books, so they know you're league with the bookstore and not just going around sticking your card into random used books, like some people do.) Make sure the reader knows you're local, that they know what you do, and make it easy for them to figure out how to contact you. It's the right message, at the right time, to the right kind of person.
