        There are objections that a man who calls himself a feminist will encounter from other men. I haven't personally encountered any of these yet, but I have a familiarity with the general arguments. The long and short of it is that men will tend to emasculate a man who is a self-described advocate for women's equality.<br /><br />Would I feel less self-worth if another man tried to emasculate me for calling myself a feminist? Hardly. It simply means that I refuse to allow some other man's definition of what it means to be a man override my own. My operating definition of my own character is based on who I personally choose to be and on my own core values. Embracing this and refusing to yield to pressure from others that would alter this definition is the first principle of being a man. (Or simply of being a good <i>person</i>.)<br /><br />One argument is that a man would only choose to do this if he's done something wrong to a woman, feels guilty, and is adopting the feminist moniker in order to atone for such a thing. I've certainly done things to women over the years that I regret. Each of these choices I've made carries its own bit of remorse that I've had to deal with, compartmentalized to the specific circumstance. I have to deal with this guilt like all people. I cannot simply call myself a "feminist" as if this were some kind of shortcut for atoning for any specific mistakes I've made.<br /><br />More importantly, I've also done things that I regret that have had adversely impacted other men, and also myself. These mistakes are more numerous in number, simply because I associate with other men and with myself more than I do other women, on the average. These mistakes haven't led me to become a men's rights advocate, or an advocate for myself. (The latter is, I suppose, what a politician is.)<br /><br />There's also the implication that you can be a man and call yourself a feminist in order to curry favor with women. Call yourself a feminist and the ladies will swoon! Instant poontang, just add social activism! Am I summarizing this argument correctly? That adopting the label of "feminist" is some kind of Faustian bargain in which you exchange your masculinity for quick and easy sex?<br /><br />To any man who would make this insinuation or accusation, I have a simple question: do you really think so little of women and their intelligence that you believe they would be so easily duped by such blatantly obvious shenanigans? If it were <i>really</i>&nbsp;that easy, I'd be willing to bet there'd be a sudden massive insurgence of men into the women's rights movement. Men aren't dumb either, and they would quickly follow the path from A to B if it really were a straight line.<br /><br />Truth be told, I do have an ulterior motive for educating myself about feminist rhetoric. I do aspire to one day be in a healthy committed relationship with a woman. While learning about women's struggles in modern civilization isn't going to magically give me that, it will help me develop a much better sense of what an individual woman's experience might be. It helps me step outside myself and see the world at large, governed by a set of forces larger than I am. It helps me ask better, more informed questions of every woman I meet in order to develop a more concrete understanding of who they are. And it helps me appreciate there are limits to the understanding I'm capable of achieving about any other human being.<br /><br />This goes beyond women. Here's the more general summary: our society is characterized by structural inequality, in the social, political, and economic spheres. I've spent most of my life turning a blind eye to these forces; this has atrophied the empathic muscles I have in my brain, not just for the plights of those who find themselves on the wrong side of these imbalances, but for all other human beings. The study of the mechanics of oppression, and more importantly, listening to the stories of those who are oppressed, is the best way to exercise these empathic muscles.

      <h1><a href="/2016/05/08/no-children.html">No Children</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">
        <span class="date">May 8, 2016</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        I was in a long-term, committed relationship for about 12 years until the middle of last year. This was with the girl I was "supposed" to marry, as those things sometimes feel, until life came between us, as life sometimes does.<br /><br />Ages ago, when we first met, I explained to her that children were, for me, a non-starter. I was willing to commit to her, but I asked her to promise me that if, in the future, she ever got to a point where she wanted children, that she would let me know right away. If this contingency ever arose, I was pretty sure that we'd have to split up.<br /><br />In hindsight, I'm not sure if this was the correct thing to do. I'm not sure if I did it with enough tact. I was trying to be honest.<br /><br />Early last year, she finally sat down with me and explained that she wanted children. She also added that she had wanted them for a couple of years, but had been afraid to tell me because, after a decade together, she didn't want to break up.<br /><br />I was given six months to decide if I wanted to change my mind about having children. If I did, then we would work towards the goal of having children together. If not, then it was an unspoken truth that this would pretty much be the end for us.<br /><br />This was a difficult six months for both of us. Not because of this looming deadline, though that would have been enough to drive any person a little crazy. It was the state of things in our relationship even before she finally told me she wanted children. Her desire to be a mother had hung unspoken between us for an extended period of time, but she had hidden this feeling from me out of fear that it would bring an end to our relationship.<br /><br />The problem is that, even if you hide these kinds of feelings, the other person isn't unaware of them. I can't be sure of the chronology, but about a year and a half before she gave me the ultimatum, I started to feel as though I was not enough of a man for her. I truly started to feel inadequate. I didn't know why, so I started to look for a reason, grasping at whatever straw seemed to make sense. I did with my feelings what she did with hers: I hid them from her.<br /><br />I'm not pointing fingers here. I'm a man, so far be it from me to claim that emotional avoidance is something that was somehow&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;fault, or something that she alone caused. I suspect we both hid parts of ourselves from each other over the years; some measure of this is probably healthy in any relationship. It seems that the children thing tipped the scales from healthy to unhealthy. We both started concealing large parts of ourselves from each other. We both started to grow on divergent paths, and we each hid this emotional growth from the other.<br /><br />So we went into this six month ultimatum with this hanging over both of our heads. We both had the sense that something wasn't quite right in our relationship. Her expressing the desire for children didn't clear the lines of communication; it merely drove the wedge that was already between us slightly deeper.<br /><br />At the end of the six months, I chose to leave her. Oddly, I had come to think that I perhaps wanted children, but in the end that mattered little to my decision. There was an increasing sense of strain on the relationship, and I didn't want to plunge into the decision to bring children into a family with so much uncertainty about our future hanging over my head. Perhaps therapy could have helped us, but I couldn't bring myself to agree to have children based on the blind faith that a psychologist could fix something that felt so broken.<br /><br />I don't think my mistake was being honest with her early on about my own desire to avoid children. My mistake was cultivating a relationship in which she was afraid to share her feelings with me. I was 21 at the time we had this conversation about children and how the prospect might affect our future. I was young, naïve, and had no idea how to broach the subject, so I simply issued the command as if were logic in a computer program: if you ever want kids, then we'll break up, else we can live out the rest of our lives happily. Screw you, young me. This was far too heavy-handed. I didn't anticipate the details of a future in which we were both still together a decade later and that this would terrify her.<br /><br />I share this for the same reason that I share any part of my story: because someone out there might identify with some part of this and learn something from it.<br /><br />The last girl I approached about a romantic relationship (after I had left my long-time girlfriend) was very adamant about <i>not</i>&nbsp;wanting children; strangely, I found this certainty off-putting. Each is entitled to their own opinions and desires, but I've come to accept that desires aren't static things. I decided I didn't want kids when I was a teenager, preserved this feeling like a taxidermist stuffing a raccoon, and mounted the damned thing on a plaque. But these feelings and desires are very much like live raccoons that you must pick up and stroke carefully from time to time. They need care and feeding. And I'm using raccoons to draw this analogy because your feelings and desires will, just like real live raccoons, occasionally bare their teeth and bite your face off.<br /><br />Come what may.

        <span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">This is a term used in art to describe a protagonist whose account of their own story is inconsistent with itself to such an extreme that it cannot be trusted by the viewer. Some of the more well-known examples of unreliable narrators in modern cinema are <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>American Psycho</i>, and <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, in which the main characters are revealed later on in the storylines to be suffering from mental illnesses of sorts. So many of the events that we've seen up to this point in the film may not have occurred as they were portrayed through the character's perspective.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Over the last few months I've written a handful of blog posts in which I claim the following: that some event occurred that spurred self-revelation, and because of this event, I could suddenly see myself clearly. These events (and the blog posts about them) just keep coming, so clearly no one of these revelations has shown me <i>all</i>&nbsp;of myself...I'm merely peeling away another layer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">This metaphor for uncovering the nature of what's in your mind, and the impact you are having on the world, is misleading. We don't actually remove deceptions and suddenly see ourselves clearly. You cannot stop perceiving yourself to be one way without putting another perception in its place. What I've done in the last few months is not eliminate a set of self-deceptions; I've reframed these self-deceptions to take another form. My sense of self has merely shifted.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">I don't suffer from extreme mental illness; I'm thankful that I haven't developed schizophrenia, for example. For the most part, I'd like to believe that I perceive reality as it is.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-family: times, times new roman, serif;">There was a study done by a psychologist that asked people to choose a pair of socks from amongst a group of pairs. The socks were all identical, but the participants were led to believe that they were </span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">different. When asked why those one pair over another, the participant would come up with a reason. We invent stories, even ones that aren't true, to explain the world around us. Connecting dots, drawing lines in the gaps of understanding, releases dopamine into our brain. We're wired for understanding even in the face of things we cannot understand.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">In speaking about scientific discoveries, and as an admonition to the scientists making them, physicist Richard Feynman once said,&nbsp;</span>"<span style="background-color: white; color: #252525; line-height: 22.4px;">The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the easiest person to fool."&nbsp;</span>I'm the narrator of my own life story, but more often than not, I'd suspect that my own story is a lattice held together by fabrications.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">So what hope is there? To paraphrase an aphorism from the field of statistics: the stories we tell ourselves are always wrong, but some stories are <i>useful</i>.</span>

        All people experience sadness, as a normal, healthy emotion. If statistics can be believed, then most people in our society will face depression at some point in their lives, which is distinct from sadness in that it can be characterized as an emotional dysfunction.<br /><br />At the extremes, it's easy to distinguish between the two. Someone who feels unhappy for a day or two because they've lost their job is clearly distinct from someone whose despair has led them out onto the ledge of an extremely tall building. But what about the gray area between? At the borderline, at what point does sadness stop being normal and start being abnormal?<br /><br />This is just one example on the spectrum of human emotions. Any individual human action, like getting angry, might be healthy in a singular context, but at what point is anger no longer healthy? I've heard these kinds of questions come up frequently. Who are we to judge what is "normal"? It's not a clearly delineated situation between yin and yang. Our judgments of ourselves and others are not only tainted by our own perceptions, but the judgments don't seem to have a relative, and not an absolute, basis for evaluation.<br /><br />Naturally, I'm not a psychologist, so it would be somewhat irresponsible of me to make any claims, but here's what I think: <i>we are only psychologically healthy to the extent that we have close relationships with others in our lives, and that those relationships are emotionally healthy</i>.<br /><br />Of course, then you'd ask how many close relationships with others a person needs to be considered healthy. I don't know. And how are we to gauge if our relationships are "emotionally healthy" or not? It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, but I believe that if a person takes a long, hard look at their own relationships, they'll find the answer to that question.

      <p class="post-meta">
        <span class="date">May 4, 2016</span>

      <div class="content">
        I have a 13-year-old cousin who loves the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, most notably the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;series of books. She's gone so far as to teach herself the language that Tolkien invented for his characters, which is called Sindarin. This makes sense because, when she was younger, she was possessed by one of the most vivid imaginations I had ever encountered in a child.&nbsp;She didn't grow up watching any television. Yet, at the age of seven, I remember her describing a world of imaginary creatures she had devised in her head, and she was explaining to me a narrative she had concocted concerning a genocide that had happened in one of them. Mouths of babes, indeed.<br /><br />We were talking about the books in the <i>Rings</i>&nbsp;series, which I haven't read, versus Peter Jackson's movies, which neither of us have seen. She was telling me about the problem with turning fantasy books into movies. The argument was simple: fantasy fiction is written to fire up the reader's imagination, so any reduction to the silver screen is defeating the whole purpose of creating a world that is larger than life. Despite the extensive and gorgeous computer imagery that Hollywood is capable of in this day and age, the visuals themselves destroy what the annals of fantasy are supposed to give to the reader.<br /><br />I've never been a fan of the fantasy genre; I've always felt that I have far too much to learn in my single lifetime about the real world that I inhabit. Trying to make sense of an imaginary world populated by hobbits seems like a waste of mental energies, especially since I don't really find such things entertaining.<br /><br />I happen to agree with my cousin on this point. I'm not saying that the Jackson movies should never have been made; I really can't be a Tolkien purist. But I would read the books before I ever chose to see the movies, because the point of the <i>Rings</i>&nbsp;series is, like any fantasy, to set the imagination on fire.<br /><br />Shortly after having this conversation, I became aware of the work of Anita Sarkeesian. For those who don't know, she started a video series designed to raise awareness of the highly sexualized manner in which women are portrayed in video games. She's comes under heavy criticism for the video series from both men and women. These rebukes range in severity from mere commentary about inconsistencies in her arguments to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian#Harassment" target="_blank">utterly insane threats of violence</a>. I've watched a few of her videos. While I don't know enough about the feminist movement yet to offer an informed criticism of the quality of her arguments, I can offer my own opinion as a man.<br /><br />I rarely play video games. I typically play puzzle games, like Tetris or (for a brief time in college) the old chestnut that was known as Snood. MarioKart has been a constant mainstay in my repertoire as it's evolved along with Nintendo's consoles. Games that feature realistic human characters have never really interested me, but I have encountered enough of them that I've formulated a few opinions about them.<br /><br />The increasing realism with which all characters are portrayed in video games has always creeped me out. Video game designers have thus far avoided the uncanny valley, the chasm between the real and the fake depictions of human beings that people find psychologically alarming. I wasn't aware of this until Sarkeesian pointed it out in one of her videos, but the manner in which women are portrayed disturbs me. It's not really a shock that the female characters are designed to embody uncommon or impossibly high standards of beauty; many of the male characters are heavily muscled in way that I'll never be. Rather, it's the fact that these women are clothed in a way that shows off their bodies, while the men remain covered. Further, the movements of the female characters within the game are highly sexualized; their hips swing and their breasts bounce in an exaggerated fashion.<br /><br />Now, I'm a man, so I'm not going to claim to be an angel. I know just as well as any man that sense of sitting in a public place, suddenly becoming aware of a woman who just entered your peripheral field of view, and your eyes dart reflexively over to look at her. So often, you feel that sense of disappointment when you realize that your peripheral vision didn't give you the whole story: she's with her boyfriend or husband, she has a wedding ring on, or she's several decades older than your peripheral impression might have led you to believe.<br /><br />So while I'm not going to assert that I don't objectify women, I've never <i>acted</i> on such objectification. I have never pursued some kind of sexual relations or romance with any woman based on appearances alone. For me, the energy expenditure required of pursuing sex with a woman is too high to operate capriciously; the sexual act must invariably be tied up in something more substantial. I will only choose to go after a woman if I get a distinct sense from her actions or words that she has a good heart, and I've assessed that the prospects of emotional commitment have a good chance of being healthy for each of us.<br /><br />I might see a woman in public, find her attractive, and get the sense that she's "available", but the thoughts of approaching her are clouded by questions that run through my head are: <i>Why her? Why is she worth my time and effort? How am I worth her time and effort? </i>I almost never have any good answers for any of these questions, so I almost never act on my first impressions. It's not that I marry every woman I'm attracted to in my head, but for whatever reason, I'm aware that approaching any stranger, man or woman, is simply unlikely to lead magically to what I might shallowly hope for in my head. I'd like to be friends with some of these strangers. Perhaps I'd like to date some of them. My expectations are always tempered by a keen awareness of my ignorance of the narrative that comprises the other person, and that, in all probability, our narratives are unlikely to overlap constructively.<br /><br />So, a cartoonish woman in a video game who's acting in a sexualized way that supposed to arouse my male curiosities has always, on some subconscious level in my head, horrified me. We're not talking about a real human being of flesh and blood who has feelings, but rather some digital creation that exists in a fake world. Sexual anthropomorphizing of such a fake thing that's supposed to represent a woman simply alarms me, and it's always led me to turn away from watching footage of these games in disgust. It feels like manipulation of my most basic humanity.<br /><br />I've always been ambivalent about the "television is evil" debate; there's probably more effective uses of your time than watching TV, but I never felt strongly enough about any aspect of it to decry it outright. I still can't say television is evil, and I've always known that it's possible for television to portray human beings, including females, in a manner that <i>simply doesn't gel with reality</i>, but I'm only just now starting to believe that passively viewing portrayals of women indiscriminately via television might be hurting me.<br /><br />I thought back to the conversation that I had with my young cousin about Tolkien's great epic, and I realized that this sense I had about video games probably applies to all forms of media. We are not to accept the imagery of Tolkien's world or characters as it has been visualized for us in the movies, and should instead allow our minds to paint our own images of them based on textual descriptions. Perhaps it is the same for men viewing renditions of women; the question arises as to what point any given rendition is dangerously misleading the thoughts in a man's head.<br /><br />I suspect this is a manner of degrees for each heterosexual man. I couldn't bring myself to be comfortable with the fake women in video games, but many men can. I can&nbsp;be comfortable with the fake women in movies and TV shows, and the fake women in the books I read, but I'm sure that some men cannot. Why is this line different for other men? Why has this line always existed in one place in my head and not another? Where should the line exist? Can I move the line in my head if I need to, and how could I do that?<br /><br />Objectification of a woman is unhealthy for a man when it's about seeing the woman as a thing to which things <i>can be done</i>, instead of seeing the woman as an autonomous person with feelings who is capable of <i>doing things</i>. When a man treats a woman this way, it's harmful not only to both the man and the woman, but to the relationship between them. A man who dehumanizes another woman by sexually objectifying her cannot do so without destroying some part of his own humanity.

      <div class="content">
        I was in my mid-twenties when the 9/11 conspiracy documentary <i>Loose Change</i>&nbsp;was released to some mild Internet acclaim. I was in the demographic of people which was most inclined to subscribe to its theories (e.g. young, white men), so I had a few friends bring it to my attention. For those of you who don't know, 9/11 conspiracy theories essentially claim that the United States government was somehow complicit in the attacks.<br /><br />I'll admit that, on the surface, it resonated with me. After the emotional impact of 9/11 had passed, there was a residual amount of healthy skepticism in our society. People asked questions at parties; George W. Bush had no sooner been elected and faced resistance from Congress to escalating military actions when suddenly, the U.S. is <i>attacked</i>. Or what about this? Or that?<br /><br />In the end, after a fairly brief investigation of the attacks themselves and the documentary itself, I concluded that the United States was attacked by a terrorist organization. Perhaps the terrorists had reasons they felt justified the attacks based on things the U.S. had done in the past...but I don't see any evidence that, for example, Colin Powell handed al-Qaeda the keys to some planes and said, "Make it look good."<br /><br />My own personal views on this particular conspiracy isn't the point I'm trying to make. I have been curious since then as to what extent a country possessed of a culture that fosters these kinds of conspiracy theories is healthy. 9/11 conspiracies haven't dissipated since <i>Loose Change</i>&nbsp;came out; if anything, they've become more numerous and pervasive. They come in all shapes and sizes, and details behind most of them put them at odds with one other. The one thing they all have in common is a mistrust of the official story that the government released.<br /><br />Early in the 20th century, the citizens of the United States seemed to live by the motto: "Trust everything." Somewhere in the middle of that century, amidst the Watergate scandal, Vietnam, and the like, people seemed to leap to "Trust no one." If my reading of history can be trusted, we went from generally trusting authority, to calling messages from <i>any</i> authority immediately into question. We seem to have skipped the more healthy middle ground of "Trust, but verify." Or perhaps we've just entered an age in which there are so many disparate sources for verification that who we collectively trust has become fragmented. Pick the story you <i>want</i>&nbsp;to believe, and find the evidence to back it up, so to speak.<br /><br />Studies of religion are limited, because scripture advocates that each individual should live a certain way. History tells us that there's never really been a time and place where every member of any free society all chose to be identical, and to follow scripture in the exact same way. The culture that arises in any given society is a system with emergent properties; the voice of dissidence seems to emerge consistently, as does the opposition to this dissidence. There's an old riddle from band: how do you tune two piccolos to be in harmony with each other? Shoot one of the players. How do you get two people to be in complete agreement? Homogeneity is a nice dream but impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Lewis Hyde writes about culture, and he wrote a book about "tricksters" in various cultures throughout history. Tricksters are the people in society who have a playful inclination to defy the rules and eschew customs. Hyde writes of this in his book: "The origins, liveliness, and durability of cultures require that there be a space for figures whose function is to uncover and disrupt the very things that cultures are based on."

        A couple of nights ago, there was a "Learn Python" workshop being held on the University of Arizona campus. There was a call by the organizer for anyone in the community who knew Python well enough to come down and walk around while the class was happening to help people struggling with the code on their machines. I've taught Python workshops before, and since I had the evening free, I went down to pitch in. I was sincerely impressed by the turnout. It was composed entirely of undergraduate students, and demographically it was very diverse. I was also far from the only volunteer: there were at least half a dozen others circulating amongst the students to help them overcome obstacles.<br /><br />I've always been interested in teaching others how to code. This was the primary reason I was drawn to helping organize tech events and entrepreneurial competitions in California. I often got the chance to swap skills with others, teach others how to do something, learn new things from others, and most importantly, help facilitate an environment that would connect people with each other. I'm grateful that I've gotten the chance to participate in, and to contribute to, this kind of culture.<br /><br />In most of the technology jobs I've had, there has been a shortage of people around to do the work that needs to get done. This is a problem on the supply-side. As technology has become ever more pervasive in our society, encompassing every aspect of life like The Blob, there is a lack of people with sufficient programming and technology experience to do the work required by society.<br /><br />In the face of a lack of competent people to work in technology fields, what we're observing comes as little surprise. I once read a book about video game programming, in which the writers made it abundantly clear early on that the mathematics of game programming are intense. They suggested that anyone who feels intimidated by video game math should consider an easier profession, like rocket science. Many of our greatest programming minds, then, are currently occupied with producing entertainment.<br /><br />Video games are simply one example; I don't mean to pick on them or decry people playing video games. The brilliance that these individuals exude, the sheer amount of effort in collaboration that must happen between <i>many people</i>&nbsp;in order to make a single video game a reality, is astounding to me. Given the mobility of the people working in these fields, it shouldn't really come as a surprise that very few of them are choosing to move to help solve the more serious problems in society.<br /><br />This comes down to individual decisions. If you are a programmer and you have your choice of what job to take, you're more likely to take a simple, very well-paid position at a tech company that produces video games than you are to take a job where you can use your technical skills to combat sex trafficking, for example. The former job will not only pay much better, but will likely be more straightforward in both job responsibilities and execution strategy.<br /><br />The technology gap is widening. This might be one of the more pressing issues of our time. Everyone needs technologists, but that technologists gravitate towards the better salaries. They do as the line from the film: they "follow the money". As has generally been the case in our society, the money fails to attract the people to where its needed most.<br /><br />This will change with time. As more people gravitate towards learning how to do computer programming, the shortage on the supply side will start to catch up with the ever-increasing demand for these skills everywhere.<br /><br />This is already in progress. In the class I helped with at the University of Arizona, there were tons of students from all manners of disciplines. They weren't just computer scientists students supplementing their own curriculum by learning a popular programming language; there were representatives from the social sciences, natural sciences, political sciences, and all other manner of sciences, labeled or otherwise. We are at the dawn of an era that will turn loose upon all of us a new generation of people who can program, but who will do more with their computer skills than merely try to be a founder of "the next Facebook".<br /><br />So should&nbsp;<i>everyone</i>&nbsp;learn to code? Nah. But I posit this: if you want to help society, if you want to help people, then explore the option of entering a computer field. If you're studying another field, learn to program and strive to use this to make new kinds of contributions to your field. We need you, because new ideas are needed everywhere.

        I'm currently on a tightrope between a fairly stable past and an uncertain future, at that point where it would be more difficult to turn and go backwards than to simply press forward into the unknown. We fear the darkness where demons dare, but even nature Herself has devised a complex ecosystem of nocturnal organisms that flourish in this darkness. The night is not something to fear, but merely another niche to fill with life.<br /><br />I'm scared of a lot of things. Chief among them is what most men are afraid of: inadequacy. I'm afraid that I simply can't or won't be enough. I fear that when confronted with the challenges life tosses at me, I won't have the courage or strength to rise to the occasion, or the wisdom to know how. And I'm afraid that this very fear will keep me avoiding those challenges.<br /><br />Like most people, I've spent most of my adult life attempting to overcome my fear of inadequacy by consistently shrinking my own world and managing it in order to keep it small. The best way of convincing yourself that you're adequate is to minimize what you're responsible for. It's certainly much easier to feel like a big person when you keep yourself confined in a small space than if you venture into the great wide open.<br /><br />I now believe the people who insist that you should have grand aspirations. In dreaming big, you don a garment that might be several sizes too big for you, but with persistence, you'll grow into it.

        I wouldn't have guessed it even five years ago, but we've come to a point where anyone can marry whoever they wish in the United States, regardless of the gender of both parties. I haven't followed the political battle that's been waged over the last decade in getting same-sex marriage legalized. When I was asked about the issue, I plead ignorance, claiming that I simply didn't know enough about the specifics to make an informed judgment.<br /><br />That's still true today, for the most part. (There's one exception: I've studied Christian scripture over the last couple of years, and I'd conclude that marriage between same-sex couples isn't something that's at odds with anything in the New Testament.) I'm still ignorant of the political, economic, and social implications of legalizing same-sex marriage. But the point is that I don't <i>need</i> to be completely informed about every aspect of this issue in order to reach a decision about it.<br /><br />Marriage is a right our society grants to people marrying those of the opposite gender; therefore, it is not a right we should deny to people who marry someone of their own gender.<br /><br />It really is just that simple. You can make the issue more complicated than that, by insisting that homosexuality is a choice and calling into question the ethics of homosexuality itself, or that the drawbacks of it will cause problems in given insurance scenarios, or any number of other things. These are irrelevant. Allowing a freedom to one class of people based on sexual orientation and denying it to another is wrong. As a society, we simply need to do what is right. It's been a long time coming, but I'm happy the United States has.
