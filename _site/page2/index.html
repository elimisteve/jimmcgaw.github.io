                      In adopting a worldview, here is the correctly ordered chronology of events:We separate feelings that make us feel good from those that make us feel bad. We desire to chase those feelings that make us feel good and avoid the bad ones.We choose beliefs that integrate with our existing beliefs, which are designed to keep the good feelings going, or avoid causing us bad feelings.We find the evidence to back up the beliefs we want...

                      There are objections that a man who calls himself a feminist will encounter from other men. I haven't personally encountered any of these yet, but I have a familiarity with the general arguments. The long and short of it is that men will tend to emasculate a man who is a self-described advocate for women's equality.Would I feel less self-worth if another man tried to emasculate me for calling myself a feminist? Hardly. It simply...

                      I was in a long-term, committed relationship for about 12 years until the middle of last year. This was with the girl I was "supposed" to marry, as those things sometimes feel, until life came between us, as life sometimes does.Ages ago, when we first met, I explained to her that children were, for me, a non-starter. I was willing to commit to her, but I asked her to promise me that if, in the...

                      This is a term used in art to describe a protagonist whose account of their own story is inconsistent with itself to such an extreme that it cannot be trusted by the viewer. Some of the more well-known examples of unreliable narrators in modern cinema are Fight Club, American Psycho, and A Beautiful Mind, in which the main characters are revealed later on in the storylines to be suffering from mental illnesses of sorts. So...

                      All people experience sadness, as a normal, healthy emotion. If statistics can be believed, then most people in our society will face depression at some point in their lives, which is distinct from sadness in that it can be characterized as an emotional dysfunction.At the extremes, it's easy to distinguish between the two. Someone who feels unhappy for a day or two because they've lost their job is clearly distinct from someone whose despair has...

                      I have a 13-year-old cousin who loves the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, most notably the Lord of the Rings&nbsp;series of books. She's gone so far as to teach herself the language that Tolkien invented for his characters, which is called Sindarin. This makes sense because, when she was younger, she was possessed by one of the most vivid imaginations I had ever encountered in a child.&nbsp;She didn't grow up watching any television. Yet, at the...

                      I was in my mid-twenties when the 9/11 conspiracy documentary Loose Change&nbsp;was released to some mild Internet acclaim. I was in the demographic of people which was most inclined to subscribe to its theories (e.g. young, white men), so I had a few friends bring it to my attention. For those of you who don't know, 9/11 conspiracy theories essentially claim that the United States government was somehow complicit in the attacks.I'll admit that, on...

                      A couple of nights ago, there was a "Learn Python" workshop being held on the University of Arizona campus. There was a call by the organizer for anyone in the community who knew Python well enough to come down and walk around while the class was happening to help people struggling with the code on their machines. I've taught Python workshops before, and since I had the evening free, I went down to pitch in....

                      I'm currently on a tightrope between a fairly stable past and an uncertain future, at that point where it would be more difficult to turn and go backwards than to simply press forward into the unknown. We fear the darkness where demons dare, but even nature Herself has devised a complex ecosystem of nocturnal organisms that flourish in this darkness. The night is not something to fear, but merely another niche to fill with life.I'm...

                      I wouldn't have guessed it even five years ago, but we've come to a point where anyone can marry whoever they wish in the United States, regardless of the gender of both parties. I haven't followed the political battle that's been waged over the last decade in getting same-sex marriage legalized. When I was asked about the issue, I plead ignorance, claiming that I simply didn't know enough about the specifics to make an informed...
