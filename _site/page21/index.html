        Watched a ten-year-old movie a few nights ago called <em>Wonder Boys</em>, which stars Michael Douglas as a college professor who teaches a writing course. The film loosely revolves around a few students who are aspiring writers and are trying to get their books published. <br /><br />Watching this movie now seems a little strange to me, because all I could think was, "Why don't all of these students just self-publish? Or start trickling their book onto the Internet via a blog?" All the pomp and circumstance of running around looking for a publisher seems passe to me.<br /><br />I still watch period pieces set in the 1960s and catch myself wondering why the characters don't just use their cell phones to communicate. Regarding cell phones, we've accepted that technology changed things. Why does self-publishing still have a stigma associated with it?

        I don't just read in order to absorb new ideas that I didn't know before. As a matter of fact, a lot of things I spend my time reading don't tell me anything I don't already know. Part of this lies in the value of the obvious; if my parents taught it to me, it's probably important, so reinforcing it can't hurt.<br /><br />But it's also about learning to phrase what I know. I've learned a lot in the last year just from my day-to-day experiences. I'm looking for someone to help me articulate that knowledge not only so I can befriend it, but so I can defend my point of view to others. It's one thing to know something, but it's entirely enough to convince someone else to consider your point of view.

        The multitude of movies that feature a post-apocalyptic setting seem to have grown with a geometric progression over the past couple of decades. Start with the end of the world, then develop the plot from that point forward. <br /><br />One of the classic "end of the world" novels is Stephen King's <em>The Stand</em>. But even King himself mentioned that the germ of the idea had its roots in story lines that preceded him. George Romero's <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, for example, has a similar premise that concerns a small band of survivors taking on an empty world (and monsters.) And George Romero himself said that in composing <em>Living Dead</em>, he basically "ripped off" Richard Matheson's <em>I Am Legend</em>. And as far as literary precedents go, you can probably go back even further than that.<br /><br />This type of storyline doesn't come as a huge surprise. If nothing else, it probably has its roots in the middle ages and survivors who passed down stories of surviving the black plague. But there's something lacking in Hollywood when every new idea has to fit into a category that's already been established. ("It's <em>28 Days Later</em>, but with werewolves and it take place in Japan.") That's the beauty of the movies that the Cohen brothers produce: when people ask others to describe the movie, the most common thing you hear is something like, "You know...it's a Cohen brothers movie." You know you're dealing with a masterpiece when the artists themselves have become the primary descriptor.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to begin where someone else left off. It takes real insight and guts to start at zero.

        I was walking around a major department store yesterday, slowly collecting an assortment of items from clearance racks. At the store I was at, merchandise tends to be disheveled, so I was taking my collection of items to the price scanner to make sure all of the ones I had were, in fact, 75% off.<br /><br />There was a couple small problems with this. First, I had to track down the location of the scanner in the store. Then, the first one that I found was in operating system mode...someone had yet to boot up the actual software that handled the scanning. So then I went off to find another one, where there was a line.<br /><br />My thinking is, the scanner itself makes sense as a mobile phone app. This makes a great deal of sense, especially in one of those Byzantine department stores. People are already scanning UPCs on their phones in order to find products in Amazon's mobile app. It's not a stretch for any major retailer to expose their inventory prices by store, detect which store the customer is at by their GPS, and give the customer their own handheld price scanner.

        Early last year, I read an old blog post by a fellow named Clay Shirky. In it he talked about the role of hard liquor during the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Consumption of copious amounts of booze, he says, was an outlet for people's frustrations at the way their lives were changing at the time. <br /><br />He then went on to say that television in America was the 20th century equivalent. As a nation, we ended up with a massive surplus of disposable time after World War II. (Thanks, Grandpa.) Since we didn't know what else to do with all that time, we started watching TV. And we've been doing it pretty steadily for the past 50+ years.<br /><br />The change he claims is happening now involves the Internet. In many ways, the Internet is merely a new way to consume content, albeit in a much more interactive and personalized way. But it also gives a platform to almost anyone who wants to be a producer. And he thinks that people are waking up to this potential they have inside them<br /><br />Mr. Shirky gave a talk about this idea, which you can <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/clay-shirky-on-cognitive-surplus/">watch here</a>. And shortly after I read the post and watched the talk, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532/">book came out</a>.It's a thought-provoking book, and if you enjoy reading about technology's impact in culture or behavior, it's worth a look. <br /><br />I think that what he's talking about is happening to some extent. People who aspire to be artists, filmmakers, or musicians who want to get exposure (or perhaps a financial foothold) have many more opportunities now than they did 20 years ago. And since it's easier, more people are doing it. <br /><br />But I don't think this is quite the movement that he makes it out to be. More people are doing it now than before, yes. But I think the vast majority of people come home from their jobs and spend their evenings watching television. They need something to wash over them and let their brain relax after a hard day's work. There's nothing wrong with this, but this behavior is not fading all that much, and it's not going to disappear anytime soon.<br /><br />And yet, even assuming that Mr. Shirky is wildly exaggerating, I pose the question: who cares if he is? There's tremendous value in social proof. Most people want to do what the people around them are doing, particularly close friends and family. <br /><br />Imagine that you stand up in front of thousands of people and say, "Everyone around you is choosing to express themselves creatively. They're forgoing watching television and making things. They're experimenting, they're starting businesses, they're trying to find their passions." Even if that is stretching the truth, a lot, people will start seeing that in the world around them. They'll notice those friends of theirs who are learning glass blowing or participating in National Novel Writing Month. It brings productive behavior and re-frames it as the norm instead of a anomaly.<br /><br />Truthfully, I don't see the harm in this, because if there's one thing we need now more than ever, it's more initiative. And I'd like to think there's many people that much smarter than me who agree with me.

        I was at a small gathering of people about a month ago. Presenting to us was a gentleman covering the life cycle of your average start-up. He broke the life of any organization into four segments:<br /><br />1. Innovate - come up with a brand new idea and develop it.<br />2. Nail It - test the idea with potential customers and refine as needed.<br />3. Scale It - grow the company; produce lots of widgets and lower your costs through volume.<br />4. Milk It - the original idea is passe; accountants and bureaucrats take over and the company (or the section of it for this one idea) putters along until it starts incurring losses, at which point it's taken out back and unceremoniously shot.<br /><br />These four steps are fairly well-established in tech start-ups. They also resonate with my own personal experience. But when the Q&A came at the end, I did what I usually do when I get bored at lectures: I started throwing curve ball questions at the presenter.<br /><br />Specifically, I asked him if there were any businesses where the jump from step #2 to step #3 doesn't actually make sense. (He didn't give me an entirely straight answer.)<br /><br />Later that evening, I thought of one: a restaurant. McDonald's is one thing, because scaling is the one reason that any of us have ever heard of them. But imagine a restaurant where the menu was created by a single chef, and he has the kind of touch where, in order for the kitchen to run, he has to be there. It would be difficult to franchise the restaurant, where the essence of the business is contingent on one person.<br /><br />I once had a management professor tell me that a healthy business is one that's growing, both in operations and financially. I think I'd be perfectly happy with comfortable stability.

        Think of the last time you went into a bookstore and ended up carrying around a short stack of books with you. Now, in this particular made-up situation, you're only going to buy one of them. You're just having trouble making a decision.<br /><br />How do you make the choice? Is it based on the author? The subject matter? The way the cover looks? The blurb on the back of the jacket?<br /><br />There's a variety of answers, but I'm willing to bet that most people have never, ever based this kind of decision on who the <em>publisher</em> of the book was. In most realms, the publisher is irrelevant. The end reader doesn't care. When Malcolm Gladwell switched publishers a couple of books ago, my guess is that nobody outside of the book publishing industry even noticed.<br /><br />This isn't actually true for me. I'm a computer programmer, and I read a lot of books in that vein. I know who all of the publishers are: O'Reilly, Pragmatic Programmers, Wrox, Apress, and Addison Wesley, to name a few of the more prominent ones. If I go into a bookstore and look for a book on a particular topic, and there are six books by six publishers on the same topic, then, all else being equal, I know which one I'm going to buy. (It would probably be the O'Reilly one.)<br /><br />For book readers, this is really unusual. The publisher doesn't generally sway the purchase decision one way or another. Computer books publishers are notable in that they've mostly stuck to their guns and focused on serving one particular audience. Most publishers have extended themselves into all kinds of different lines of books, and in the process, they've made themselves largely irrelevant to readers.<br /><br />Is it any surprise that most of them are in trouble now?<br /><br />What makes a computer publisher like O'Reilly stand out is they understand that they're a (not to be diminutive) glorified middleman. Most publishers are. This is a difficult task to carry out, and it's become exponentially harder since the Internet came along and gave people an almost infinite choice of alternative things to read. <br /><br />And despite this, O'Reilly has done remarkably well. Why? Partly because Tim O'Reilly is brilliant. But more importantly, because they're extremely good at one thing: <em>curation</em>.<br /><br />An art gallery understands they only have so much space on their walls to hang art (and only so much money to spend on great pieces), so they take great care to understand what their visitors want to see. Then they put that on display. O'Reilly understands Uber-Geeks like me and what we're interested in reading, so they find experts on those topics and ask them to write books.<br /><br />In a world where the long tail and infinite choice are becoming the norm, there are still plenty of groups of people willing to pay for judgment.

        Why are we always so attracted to massive ideas?<br /><br />Talk about opening a coffee shop, creating an iPhone app for checking traffic reports, or say you're going to write a screenplay that's reminiscent of <em>Crash</em> that will require massive financial backing, then encouragement will beat a path to your door. Do it, everyone says, because they know that if you win, then you win big. At least, big enough to make it worth your trouble.<br /><br />But if you suggest creating a web site to, say, sell special tools for tending orchids to enthusiasts, then you're met with doubt: "Eh, how many orchid enthusiasts are there out there, really?"<br /><br />All else being equal--namely, the certainty of a payoff--then the size of the payoff should guide the decision. But the certainty between large and small isn't always comparable.

        I'm not actually one for watching a lot of news. The breaking headlines about the situation in Egypt didn't interest me at all in the beginning, when the revolution first started. As soon as I caught wind of Mubarak stepping down, however, I immediately had to read about the revolution and what had happened.<br /><br />I like news as soon as it becomes history, when the story we're hearing about reaches its conclusion. I guess I don't fancy an unresolved narrative; I don't enjoy the speculative conversations in which people talk at length about what "could happen". Tell me when things wrap up, and then I can draw my lessons about life from what transpired.<br /><br />This might be a large part of the reason I'm not inclined towards politics, but am fascinated by history. And it's difficult for me to say exactly when the former becomes the latter.

        You remember the drill: a group of students from your school are going to leave school and visit someplace, and you've got to take home a permission slip for your parents to sign. The school couldn't just pull you out of your regular routine and take you someplace. They had to get the okay from your folks. <br /><br />At other times, if you wanted to do something, you had to raise your hand and ask the teacher if it was okay, like whether you could go to the bathroom or speak. (You know, because otherwise kids would be peeing and speaking out of turn with reckless abandon, and we wouldn't want that.)<br /><br />Most of us were raised on asking for the okay from someone else. It's instilled in us. And we're all very comfortable with it, because when something goes wrong, we have someone with whom we can share the blame. (For instance, I'm pretty sure those permissions slips partially served as legal waivers.)<br /><br />In our adult years, we don't take home permission slips or have to raise our hands. Instead, we ask for a paycheck.<br /><br />"That sounds like a good idea," we say. "Are you willing to pay me to do that?" <br /><br />"I don't know if I should major in that. Will I be able to find a job?"<br /><br />Or: "Maybe I shouldn't be doing this. I might get fired."<br /><br />However it looks, there's always the same underlying cause: a nagging fear that we're going something we're not supposed to do, and we're looking for someone to tell us we're aren't wrong. That it's okay. That we should keep doing what we're doing.<br /><br />Television usually doesn't judge the viewer. This is why it's so tremendously popular.<br /><br />Life is too short to sit around waiting for someone, or some other external force of nature, to validate your plans. If you can't get past that, pretend you've got a permission slip and that I just signed it. You have my blessing to try, to fail, to try again, and repeat until you succeed.<br /><br />Not that you needed it.
