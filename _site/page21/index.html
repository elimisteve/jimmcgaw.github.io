                      Watched a ten-year-old movie a few nights ago called <em>Wonder Boys</em>, which stars Michael Douglas as a college professor who teaches a writing course. The film loosely revolves around a few students who are aspiring writers and are trying to get their books published. <br /><br />Watching this movie now seems a little strange to me, because all I could think was, "Why don't all of these students just self-publish? Or start trickling their book...

                      I don't just read in order to absorb new ideas that I didn't know before. As a matter of fact, a lot of things I spend my time reading don't tell me anything I don't already know. Part of this lies in the value of the obvious; if my parents taught it to me, it's probably important, so reinforcing it can't hurt.<br /><br />But it's also about learning to phrase what I know. I've learned...

                      The multitude of movies that feature a post-apocalyptic setting seem to have grown with a geometric progression over the past couple of decades. Start with the end of the world, then develop the plot from that point forward. <br /><br />One of the classic "end of the world" novels is Stephen King's <em>The Stand</em>. But even King himself mentioned that the germ of the idea had its roots in story lines that preceded him. George...

                      I was walking around a major department store yesterday, slowly collecting an assortment of items from clearance racks. At the store I was at, merchandise tends to be disheveled, so I was taking my collection of items to the price scanner to make sure all of the ones I had were, in fact, 75% off.<br /><br />There was a couple small problems with this. First, I had to track down the location of the scanner...

                      Early last year, I read an old blog post by a fellow named Clay Shirky. In it he talked about the role of hard liquor during the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Consumption of copious amounts of booze, he says, was an outlet for people's frustrations at the way their lives were changing at the time. <br /><br />He then went on to say that television in America was the 20th century equivalent.

He broke the life of any organization into four segments:<br /><br />1. Innovate - come up with a brand new idea and develop it.<br />2. Nail It - test the idea with potential customers and refine as needed.<br />3. Scale It - grow the company; produce lots of widgets...

Now, in this particular made-up situation, you're only going to buy one of them. You're just having trouble making a decision.<br /><br />How do you make the choice? Is it based on the author?
