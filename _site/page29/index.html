        I'm out of town for Christmas this year, as is my girlfriend. We have absolutely no need for the Internet in our apartment for the two weeks or so that we're going to be gone. But we're going to pay for it, because you pay monthly, and the service can't be turned on and off by request.<br /><br />Phil Spector once said that he hated albums; he described them as being two singles and filler. The economics of music distribution, however, made it difficult to profitably distribute individual songs, and so for years, artists bundled ten or more songs together. If you wanted just one, you were out of luck, because you had to buy all the rest, too.<br /><br />iTunes and digital music changed this. It's not likely that Internet Service Providers are going to make this change anytime soon, but I still wonder: the electric company gives me light switches and a metered rate. Doesn't that make sense for bandwidth?

        I think I understand the idea: you give someone a greeting card, and inside there's a message that reads, "A donation of $20 has been made in your name to [charity name here]".<br /><br />The problem is, this doesn't work. It makes the giver feel good, twice over, but it doesn't make the recipient feel much of anything. Whatever that powerful feeling is that results from generosity is non-transferable. The best the recipient can hope for is a funny joke inside the card.<br /><br />Starbucks has a "Red" gift card you can get, which triggers a 5 cent donation to the Global Fund each time you use the card. I got one from a friend recently, as a gift, so this donation happens whenever I use the card.<br /><br />I'm perfectly aware that I'm just a spoiled yuppie buying overpriced coffee, and it's less than $20, but I think it's closer to ideal than the greeting card. Maybe the feeling matters more than the money.

        At my last job, our office was on the second floor of a two-story building. The office was on top, and below us was a retail bridal shop. One day, one of the ladies working downstairs came up to talk to us about something. At some point, she asked us, "Have you guys heard the ghost yet?"<br /><br />What ghost, we all asked, eyebrows raised.<br /><br />"Oh, there's a ghost up here. The people who occupied this space before you used to refuse to go in that back room you have, because they got chills and heard the ghost making a ruckus."<br /><br />If you don't believe in ghosts, an interesting question emerges: where did this ghost come from?<br /><br />Coca-Cola might have invented Santa Claus as we know him today, but he was born of something deeper than the need for a corporate image. He filled a need in the era in which he promulgated; he seems to come from the same place that gives us most urban legends. It's intangible, and it's hidden, but it's there, just beneath the surface. <br /><br />The more interesting part is that Santa has survived for decades because of parents who perpetuate the story...makes it sounds like a conspiracy theory, doesn't it?<br /><br />Oh, and I'm not saying Santa isn't real. He is. If you see him tonight, offer a fist-bump for me.

        Let me preface this post by saying that I know absolutely nothing about the internal workings of public education. I'm not qualified to offer suggestions about how to make how it works better. But I take it on good authority (by that, I mean teachers working in public education) that the tried and true solutions in the business world can't just be applied to public education.<br /><br />I think they're right. And I'll go them one further: the rules of the business world aren't good for business, either.<br /><br />In a large business, the strategy tends to come from the top down. Without any real insight or skill, this "strategy" tends to take the form of rules. Don't do this, don't do that, and so on. The orders come from the top, and they are expected to be carried out by the minions of employees below. Sometimes they have to trickle down through several layers of management, which means that some organizations are functioning like a Pachinko machine. Let's call it the command-and-conquer strategy.<br /><br />It's works for the military, but it doesn't work when you're dealing with people who are knowledge workers.<br /><br />If you look at what makes an organization successful, I'd say it's the people working for it. And what makes a person happy and productive isn't necessarily just the salary they receive or the difference they're making the world, but it's largely driven by the autonomy that their job affords them.<br /><br />A knowledgeable nurse who's given the leeway to apply her own knowledge is more likely to save a patient's life than one who is instructed to execute the doctor's orders. Programmers are more productive if they're given space to sprint instead of step-by-step instructions to follow. Instruction displaces intuition, but intuition is where brilliant things happen.<br /><br />Here's the key insight: teachers are NOT interchangeable cogs. They are knowledge workers. And the current public education system is working very hard to micro-manage the hell out of them. They have to answer to their administration, and to the parents of the children their teaching, both of whom feel they know how best to educate children, but most of them <em>are not teachers!</em><br /><br />We've taken the mentality of the factory, and of an assembly line full of workers, and applied it to our school system.  <br /><br />Think of the scene in Pink Floyd's <em>The Wall</em> where the students, their faces already indistinguishable from one another, are being marched into a meat grinder. This is happening today, but we're not doing it to our students...we're doing it to our teachers. And this mentality is, directly, adversely affecting the education kids get.<br /><br />One thing comes from the business section that is relevant to this discussion: often, people are encouraged to ignore their managers and do what they think is best. It's that old chestnut about it being better to ask for forgiveness later than permission now, so to speak. I enjoy watching people who are affecting public education break the rules. The best example I can dredge up is Jamie Oliver, who, while he's working outside of education, is really pissing a lot of people off by questioning and breaking rules.<br /><br />I really think that change in education is not going to come from the top, when the rulemakers finally recognize that things are broken. When we look at the revolutions that have happened in any industry, they don't come from the people in charge but from people at the bottom who decided to stir up trouble. Borders should have created Amazon, but they didn't...Jeff Bezos did.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like I don't know what I'm talking about, you're probably right. Let me turn the mic over to Sir Ken Robinson. He's a brilliant man who has great ideas about education, and he's on a mission to persuade people that our current system doesn't need fixing...it needs replacing. And he's dangerous, because his ideas are lucid and sensible enough to stick with you for a long time. They just might change you.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms.html">Watch it here.</a> If you like it, there's several other Ken talks online. I recommend you watch all of them.

        One of the most popular art shows ever to air on television wasn't even really about art.<br /><br />I've watched "The Joy of Painting" dozens or even hundreds of times since I first discovered him in sixth grade. And yet, I haven't picked up a paint brush since I did those paint-by-number watercolor books when I was in elementary school. I bet a lot of his viewers are like me, and have never even tried painting, but they know what a fan brush is and they go looking for Van Dyke brown when they're in an art supply store.<br /><br />Bob Ross himself said that part of what he set out to do with his program was to give people a place of tranquility and inner peace. He offered a break from the stress of their daily lives. I know a few people who are trying to give this to people by telling them to meditate, to try Buddhism, to go to Yoga classes, and so on. But most people, as stressed as they are, aren't necessarily looking for a relaxation solution or a major lifestyle change.<br /><br />You can get it from Bob, though, who brilliantly disguised this gift as a television show about painting. And you won't realize what he's given you until after it's too late.

        Recently, I thought it would be a good idea to open up a small, independent consumer electronics store. My thinking is that "Wired" magazine is a really compelling periodical that stays on the cutting edge of technology. The audience of the magazine is pretty mainstream, but there's certainly a small segment of people reading it that really geek out over new tech products. <br /><br />A retail chain like Radio Shack or Best Buy serves a mainstream audience too, but they both fall short of delivering an optimal experience to tech geeks. The serve the middle of the bell curve just fine, where people are looking to walk in and buy a Dell laptop or iPhone case. But the nerds at the fringes don't get much of an experience.<br /><br />I believe it starts with the employees you hire. Get people who really love photography, building robots with legos, or hacking the bluetooth in their toasters to do cool things. Offer them a decent wage, and encourage them to bring their hobbies to work with them to share with the people who come in. Can't you think of at least one friend you might know who would enjoy working under these circumstances?<br /><br />Personal passion will always outsell following the instructions in a training manual.<br /><br />I pass by a comic book shop near my home almost daily, and the nerds who work there are always playing some game (maybe D&D) at odds hours of the evening. It's not just a comic book shop...you can go in and buy a graphic novel, but there's stuff happening at the same time. There's a sense of community. Such a store could hold local competitions to build a better widget, or other contests.<br /><br />Like a lot of ideas, this one is neither good nor bad in and of itself. Whether the idea would work is reality is larger based on the finesse of the execution, and probably some luck. You'd need good people, and you'd need an eye for creating an experience people would like enough to return to.<br /><br />I don't know how well it would scale. Business school hammered it into me that businesses should always be worried about how to achieve volume, but the elements that make this work--the largest of which is personable staff--don't scale. I'm not sure that worrying about scale should always be part of the plan.

        Albert Camus begins <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> with a rather dark assertion: "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy." In essence: you can wax intellectual about the meaning of life until you're sore in the throat, but what really matters is whether or not your train of thought leads you to conclude that your own life is worth living. (Along those lines, I would think that the second truly serious philosophical problem would be whether or not to have kids.)<br /><br />I think people spend a lot of time thinking along these lines...most of us just aren't morbid enough to call it "suicide". That actions of most people, once they've started shedding their innocence, start to look for meaning or a purpose behind their own existence. Beyond basic survival, it's the motive that drives most human behavior in a civilized society.<br /><br />True empathy is recognizing that this is what most of the people around you are doing. Compassion is the act of suspending judgment, giving them space, and getting out of their way while they're struggling to do it.

        Imagine you're a scribe in the 15th century. Imagine that you know what it means to sit by candlelight in the cold and copy books by hand.<br /><br />One day, this groovy cat named Gutenberg shows up on your doorstep and tells you he's just invented this thing called moveable type, which makes the printing of books much faster, cheaper, and more efficient than it ever has been before.<br /><br />Remember, you're a scribe...how do you react to this news? My guess is that it makes you uncomfortable, and you get that Gutenberg fellow the hell off of your front porch just as politely and quickly as you can.<br /><br />You're not trying to be emotional about this whole prospect of a new piece of technology that changes what you do; you're just very cozy with things the way they are. You've built a lifestyle, a livelihood, and a batch of co-workers, with whom you can share the 15th century equivalent of Dilbert cartoons, around copying books with quills. And you know that if this goes away, your life changes.<br /><br />So, you resist. <br /><br />As the new technology proliferates, rumors (mysteriously) appear and spread that this new influx of books is going to tear apart the moral fabric of society.<br /><br />I wrote a book last year, and more recently, a version was created and listed for sale  on Amazon for the Kindle e-reader. (I wasn't told about this, I just noticed it happened one day, but that's beside the point.) The thing I'm confused about as a beneficiary of the book's sales revenue--albeit as a minority one--is this: why does the digital version of the book cost almost as much as the hard copy?<br /><br />eBooks, as a medium, have a problem: people don't want to pay that much for them, because the value isn't clear. If you buy a print book, you can finish it and lend it to a friend. With digital books, that functionality isn't there, and it feels cheaper because you don't get a hard copy of a book that you can throw at the co-worker who's annoying you.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks to readers, this solves some problems for book publishers. They reduce the cost of spoilage, so that books that don't sell don't have to be shipped back to the manufacturer and destroyed. And they don't need warehousing, instead being stored as bits on a server, where the carrying cost is essentially zero.<br /><br />And yet, most Kindle books cost almost as much as their physical counterparts. And book publishers <em>hate</em> them, and fight them tooth and nail. They're busy trying to defend the higher prices as being a function of the economics of their industry. Economics which, I might remind you, just fundamentally changed.<br /><br />At most major book publishers today, there's a scribe at the helm. With that in mind, we can presume that the contention over the eBook format won't vanish anytime soon. It's not a good time to act like a traditional publishing house, because playing by scribe rules will only get you so far now that the game has changed. <br /><br />It is, however, a great time to be an author, because we can all strive to be rogue Gutenbergs. And opportunities to do that abound in the world of the Internet and the realm of digital books.

        I was in a meeting last week with about a dozen people who were planning an event for Christmas day. At the back of the room was a hard-working, good-natured gentleman who had a lot of things to say. And he said most of them out loud, without reservation, for the rest of us to hear.<br /><br />It was painfully obvious to anyone, including him, that after so long, people were starting to tune him out. After a few minutes of him speaking, everyone started exchanging knowing glances. He words started to lose their effect on the group.<br /><br />And so, in response to this, his solution was simple: talk <em>more</em>.<br /><br />I'm sure you've been in an identical situation. This is the way most people to respond to not being heard. Given a barrage of information, people start to tune out, and the default response is to say more things, add more details, add more clarification, and so on. Faced with the problem of over-communication, people fight fire with fire.<br /><br />If you have too much to say, you should probably say less. Even if it kills you to hold your tongue.

        Waiting isn't always the hardest part. Most of us spend our entire lives waiting for people to give us things. We email the resume, then wait for the right person to find it and offer us a dream job.<br /><br />Usually, waiting is the easiest thing we can do. Waiting for a recruiter to call us is easier than calling companies on the phone. Waiting for the casting director to call us back so we can land a breakout role in a television pilot. Waiting for someone else to give us the go-ahead, so if we fail, we feel less responsible.<br /><br />Tom Petty had it wrong; waiting is one of the easiest things we can do. And in so doing, the risk matches the reward.
