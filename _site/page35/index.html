                      In my experience, most companies that use blogs to promote themselves are getting it wrong. The reason is simple: try to imagine reading a newspaper where all the articles are written about what's happening at that newspaper's headquarters. Would anyone read that?

                      It was over six months ago that Apple released the iPad. I'm not one to blog at length about technology or Apple products, but I remember the day it came out, buzz on the Internet pointed at the iPad as being a ridiculous piece of hardware that was little more a large version of an iPhone, and droves of people heralded it as the product release that would ruin Apple.This criticism is easily forgotten at...

                      I'm a little cynical about the effectiveness of traditional advertising, so this post comes with a grain of salt. Barack Obama managed to raise $50 million in a month because he was able to leverage the power of the Internet. He had no shortage of funds or supporters, and there's probably not a simple answer, but:Did he win the election in 2008 because he had the money? Did he win the election because he got...

                      Sociologist Ray Oldenburg made a compelling case for every person's need for a third place. That is, we're social creatures that crave a place to spend time at, other than our homes or where we work during the day. And in the book Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam makes a pretty compelling argument that the United States had its third places dwindle substantially during the twentieth century.Scott Heiferman read Bowling Alone and, instead of commiserating about...

                      Thanksgiving is in just over a month from now, which means that food banks and soup kitchens are just starting to plan for their holiday events. For those of us lucky enough to have food on our tables, I'd like to share an idea.If you're a retailer or a grocery store, take some of your marketing or advertising budget for the holiday season and put it into gift cards in the amount of $5, $10,...

                      There are thousands or even tens of thousands of stereotypes in this world. Going by profession: Lawyers are greedy. Accountants have no sense of humor. Salespeople are dishonest. And so on.When someone chooses to attack the stereotype, though, and acts in a way that we didn't expect, it causes us to open our eyes and take notice. Stereotypes aren't just a mechanism present in the morally bankrupt; they're a faculty of the human brain that's...

                      The other day I somehow clicked into a news article in which the author claimed that President Obama's federal committee of scientists had determined that the damage from the BP oil leak in the gulf was going to be "negligible". (I don't remember where I read this; I found it by accident while looking for something completely different.) The author made this claim without citing any sources, references, or data of any kind.It's no secret...

                      I used to work in an office where they got furious with me if I came into work and was sick. "Why are you here?" they'd ask me. "Are you trying to get the rest of us sick?" They'd feel so strongly about it that they would send me home for the day. It makes sense because self-interest the motivator: getting sick is lousy, so better to let me have the time off than risk...

                      The print map industry used to be big business. Everyone needed maps to keep in their cars whenever they were going on long trips. The more detailed, the better, because you didn't want to end up someplace and not be able to figure out where you were. And you had to buy new ones every few years because sometimes things changed, and you didn't want to be driving around looking for Sao Paulo Street only...

                      Watched an old movie last night called The Birds, one of Alfred Hitchcock's later movies. A rather odd movie that doesn't fit so much with the rest of Hitchcock's movies, and falls more into the "nature turns against man for no reason" category.I remember watching this movie as a kid and thinking it was at times extremely boring and at times extremely cheesy. The horror didn't really seem believable, and it took an entire hour...
