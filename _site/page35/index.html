        It was over six months ago that Apple released the iPad. I'm not one to blog at length about technology or Apple products, but I remember the day it came out, buzz on the Internet pointed at the iPad as being a ridiculous piece of hardware that was little more a large version of an iPhone, and droves of people heralded it as the product release that would ruin Apple.<br /><br />This criticism is easily forgotten at this point, now that the iPad has made such an impact on people who use computers and launched Apple's own stock valuation. But it's something to keep in mind the next time someone tells you not to do something because you're certain to fail.

        I'm a little cynical about the effectiveness of traditional advertising, so this post comes with a grain of salt. Barack Obama managed to raise $50 million in a month because he was able to leverage the power of the Internet. He had no shortage of funds or supporters, and there's probably not a simple answer, but:<br /><br />Did he win the election in 2008 because he had the money? <br /><br />Did he win the election because he got the money; not because of the money, but because it rallied voters around him?<br /><br />Did he win because contributors felt attached to him after contributing to his campaign?<br /><br />There's probably a correlation between how much money a political candidate spends on their campaign and how likely they are to win. Me, I think Obama got all that money because he stood for something that people had an easy time believing in. He didn't win because of the money, and yet, if hadn't been able to raise it, he probably wouldn't have won. The support had to come first.

        Sociologist Ray Oldenburg made a compelling case for every person's need for a third place. That is, we're social creatures that crave a place to spend time at, other than our homes or where we work during the day. And in the book <em>Bowling Alone</em>, Robert Putnam makes a pretty compelling argument that the United States had its third places dwindle substantially during the twentieth century.<br /><br />Scott Heiferman read <em>Bowling Alone</em> and, instead of commiserating about the idea, decided to do something about it. The idea for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> was born out of the hypothesis presented in the book. It encouraged people to create groups online that members of the local community could join, and periodically, the members of the group have to meet in person, offline. <br /><br />Ten years later, in the era of Facebook, the site is a little bit dated, but the spirit of what Heiferman was trying to do is certainly important. Human beings need to belong, and need a group to identify with. This is why the coffee shops I regularly go to always seem to have the same half a dozen or so people lurking around outside smoking and sipping coffee. Starbucks isn't just in the coffee business; they're in the business of offering a third place to people who want the whole "Cheers" vibe from someplace that isn't home or work.<br /><br />I don't know where you live, but most places I've ever visited in this country have a community shortage. (Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places for it.) With this in mind, though, perhaps there's the opportunity to start something that creates community. For those of us who are fortunate enough to have basic needs and safety needs taken care of, maybe we should move up Maslow's hierarchy.

        Thanksgiving is in just over a month from now, which means that food banks and soup kitchens are just starting to plan for their holiday events. For those of us lucky enough to have food on our tables, I'd like to share an idea.<br /><br />If you're a retailer or a grocery store, take some of your marketing or advertising budget for the holiday season and put it into gift cards in the amount of $5, $10, or $20 dollars apiece. Then, put these cards into the hands of churches and non-profit organizations for them to give to their volunteers as a "thank you" for helping out around Thanksgiving.<br /><br />If you're planning on being open for business the day after, this makes a whole lot of sense. Why more retailers aren't clamoring to get gift cards into the hands of as many people as they can the day before the biggest shopping day of the year is a mystery to me. But then, good opportunities tend to reside in what no one else is doing.<br /><br />One thing for the charitable organizations: they must be <em>gifts</em>, given after the fact, and only after the fact. You shouldn't entice volunteers into your place on Thanksgiving with promises of a gift card or else you run the risk people will show up just for the reward. It's a gift, not a means of sweetening a deal.<br /><br />Chances are good I'm not reaching anyone who works for a non-profit or controls the marketing budget for a consumer retailer. But maybe you know someone who does, and could tell them for me?

        There are thousands or even tens of thousands of stereotypes in this world. Going by profession: Lawyers are greedy. Accountants have no sense of humor. Salespeople are dishonest. And so on.<br /><br />When someone chooses to attack the stereotype, though, and acts in a way that we didn't expect, it causes us to open our eyes and take notice. Stereotypes aren't just a mechanism present in the morally bankrupt; they're a faculty of the human brain that's designed to help us quickly reach conclusions. In a world in which we're bombarded with more information than we can process cognitively, they're a helpful shortcut.<br /><br />The problem is that until we see something that challenges the stereotype, we're not likely to question it. And the stronger the stereotype, the more likely we are to ignore the evidence that counters it.<br /><br />People around you expect certain things from you. They expect you to say certain things, act a certain way, respond to things the way they've come to expect. Doing something unexpected, though, forces them to challenge their preconceptions.<br /><br />Go do something different.

        The other day I somehow clicked into a news article in which the author claimed that President Obama's federal committee of scientists had determined that the damage from the BP oil leak in the gulf was going to be "negligible". (I don't remember where I read this; I found it by accident while looking for something completely different.) The author made this claim without citing any sources, references, or data of any kind.<br /><br />It's no secret that misinformation abounds on the Internet. I'm old enough to remember that when Wikipedia first emerged, it was widely flogged for containing inaccurate information. That problem hasn't been solved 100%, but there's still the danger of getting bad information.<br /><br />One thing that Internet can provide to anyone: inspiration. Usually, the inspiration to do something isn't fact-based. Getting yourself out of a rut you're stuck in doesn't require you to educate your way out. It can be a simple as a single sentence that changes things for you, or a story about someone in the same situation as you who found their way through it. The motivation to push through abounds on the Internet. The information is out there, ripe for the plucking, if you choose to go for it.<br /><br />The trick is in knowing where to look for it...and if you already <em>have</em> been looking, then start looking in different places.

        I used to work in an office where they got furious with me if I came into work and was sick. "Why are you here?" they'd ask me. "Are you trying to get the rest of us sick?" They'd feel so strongly about it that they would send me home for the day. It makes sense because self-interest the motivator: getting sick is lousy, so better to let me have the time off than risk it.<br /><br />And yet, we don't act this way about emotions. Moods, emotions, and thoughts spread like diseases among groups of people. General malaise, frustration, or anger are transmitted like contagions through networks of people. Psychologists have found that if you spend time in the company of depressed and pessimistic people who feel like losers, you yourself will start to feel more depressed, pessimistic, and like a loser.<br /><br />And so, we make ourselves sick. What really amazes me is that we don't send these people home. I wonder why this is, since the damage can be far worse, and more permanent, to those around you if you're going around spreading a negative world view instead of just the common cold.

        The print map industry used to be big business. Everyone needed maps to keep in their cars whenever they were going on long trips. The more detailed, the better, because you didn't want to end up someplace and not be able to figure out where you were. And you had to buy new ones every few years because sometimes things changed, and you didn't want to be driving around looking for Sao Paulo Street only to learn the name had been changed to Gondola Street two years ago.<br /><br />Now, we use GPS, Google Maps, and the mapping applications that come on our smart phones. <br /><br />The print map industry died because of the Internet; not an original story, but the slow bleeding out of large print map companies happened out of view of the general public. Unless you worked for a print map company, you probably never gave it a second thought. It's not like the music industry and the RIAA, which has intellectual property arguments on their side. With no way of claiming copyright over cartography, the print map industry was stuck without anybody they could sue. And so they perished quietly, without much of a fight.<br /><br />I met a DJ at a party recently who came with digital equipment for spinning. Among his things was a large box of LPs, which didn't serve any purpose, save for people thumbing through them and remarking about the corniness of past musical acts like Wham! I asked the DJ about the market for records, and told me, "Actually, the market for LPs is stronger than that of CDs. It's growing more than CDs, anyway...CDs are dying off, but people are buying more LPs because they're a collector's item."<br /><br />What he said might not be an entirely accurate statement, but I believe that where he buys the bulk of his LPs&mdash;in the used music shops in Los Angeles&mdash;it's likely a very observable trend. This makes sense...there's no good reason for CDs. They just happened to the best the most convenient way of acquiring, storing, and playing music before MP3s and always-on Internet connections came along. The utility is gone.<br /><br />Naturally, LPs are pretty useless as well, since they wear out, they're large and fragile, and I really have no idea where I'd acquire a turntable if I had to buy one tomorrow. There's no convenience there.<br /><br />People buy LPs for one very simple reason: <em>novelty</em>. To some extent, this is true of CDs as well. I went to a concert last week, and the vendor was selling the artist's CDs right along with the T-shirts. No practical reason to buy the CD...I could get the music for half the price on iTunes, and the disc itself will just be clutter that I'll eventually throw away. But I almost bought one for the novelty of buying it, having it (for a while), and supporting the artist. (Something similar could be said of the T-shirts.)<br /><br />MapQuest was around for years before Google Maps came along, but Google's version won out because they acquired Keyhole and offered satellite imagery, and worked in Ajax-enabled click and drag. MapQuest was practical. Google was novel.<br /><br />The print map industry isn't going to come back anytime soon, simply because few people want to buy a paper map for any practical reason. But eople might buy maps printed on silk or shiny soft polyester. They might buy hologram maps. Just a few months ago I bought some postcard maps created with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing">lenticular printing</a> for my little cousin that changed from day to night.<br /><br />I think potential pockets of untapped novelty are hidden everywhere...not just for print maps. It's a strategy worth considering just because there's usually already someone else trying very hard to offer the most utility.

        Watched an old movie last night called <em>The Birds</em>, one of Alfred Hitchcock's later movies. A rather odd movie that doesn't fit so much with the rest of Hitchcock's movies, and falls more into the "nature turns against man for no reason" category.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie as a kid and thinking it was at times extremely boring and at times extremely cheesy. The horror didn't really seem believable, and it took an entire hour for the film to even start involving any bird-related issues of any kind. Since I was pretty young when I first saw it, most of the character build-up was completely lost on me...I was just watching it to see birds kill people.<br /><br />Watching it now, several years later, I realize that the movie is supposed to be about people. All of that build-up in the characters I thought was tedious as a kid now makes sense. It's clear to me now that Hitchcock was trying to create a film about people, and the whole deadly bird thing is supposed to play second fiddle.<br /><br />This is what Stephen King always does so well...he creates realistic characters. His books spend a great deal of time building up characters, and all throughout, it's possible to peer inside the character's head, see what they're thinking, to empathize with them. The essence of his books is the people.<br /><br />Of course, take that element out of the story and what do you have? A Stephen King movie. Most film adaptations have missed this distinction and assume, mistakenly, that King's work is successful <em>because</em> it's about vampires, telekinetic teen girls, zombie cats, or lunatic alcoholic writers in isolated Colorado hotels. As a result, the films end up casted with B-list actors and focus on things that goes bump in the night. Good for a campy scare when you're nine years old, but not terribly meaningful.<br /><br />Then again, maybe for horror, "meaningful" isn't the point. I didn't watch <em>The Birds</em> when I was a pre-teen for the romantic storyline.

      <h1><a href="/2010/10/18/organizing-photos.html">Organizing Photos</a></h1>

      <div class="content">
        Every so often, a friend of mine creates a photo album on Facebook called "Random stuff" or something similar, the contents of which have no common thread save for the fact that they were taken by the same person carting around a camera with them. (I find these are generally the most entertaining albums to click through.)<br /><br />I don't take a whole lot of digital photos and I don't own a camera, but most of my friends have had one for at least a few years now. The expense of taking a digital photograph is essentially zero, so lots of people have been taking a camera with them almost everywhere, taking photos without a second thought (taking two or three at times to make sure one comes out), and then periodically dumping these things onto their home computer. Which means that most people probably have dozens and dozens of folders in their "My Pictures" folder, each one named after the date on which the directory was created, and each one containing dozens of hundreds of photographs. <br /><br />Organizing all of these photos is one big pain that's only going to get worse as we go forward. The only way of dealing with all of this clutter is to manually parse through all of these files, look at each one, and figure out where it goes. If memory serves, you can pluck out all of the interesting photos from your Aunt Marge's wedding and put them online into a single photo album.<br /><br />The problem with albums, just like with directories on our computer, is that every photo ends up in a single place. (You could start copying photos around into multiple directories, but this would just compound the nightmare.) Tagging alleviates this problem to some degree...each person on Facebook has an album that's "theirs". I didn't take most of the photos, but if anyone tags me in any photo in any album, it becomes a part of my "Jim McGaw" album. Other photo services like Flickr offer this kind of functionality on crack, and it allows for an almost infinite number of clumps to appear.<br /><br />It's not helpful that most of the photos are assigned auto-incrementing generic names like "IMG_0521201011.jpg", which have no semantic meaning whatsoever. Google's Picasa photo-sharing service has a feature that is able to recognize the faces of people you know so they can be auto-associated with these photos, eliminating the need for manual tagging. It's interesting to ponder a future in which digital cameras will be able to tag photos for you, either based on the people in them or other content it can detect, and these tags could be used to organize content before it even reaches your computer or the Internet. Or, at the very least, maybe it would solve the naming problem.<br /><br />My guess is that someone already tried to do this, but the camera's interface ended up being dozens and dozens of tiny buttons that would make even a seasoned engineer weep. I'd be interested in seeing what it looks like when someone (Apple?) gets it right.
