                      One of the hardest parts of running any business is finding new customers. It's a matter of getting your message to the right people. Timing is important, too. If you're running a pizza parlor, you can probably run ads on local television stations around dinner time, flash a phone number on the screen, and, provided the pizza itself is bearable, you'll probably do pretty well for yourself.There's probably potential for small businesses to do this...

                      I'm talking about the game with the little spinning cage of balls and the cards with the letter-number combinations on them. Each player has a card, the person running the game picks a ball at random from the cage and calls it out, and if the player has that combination on their card, they cover it. Five covered squares in a row on a card is a winner.The one virtue of any game that is...

                      Of all the material things to which this maxim could apply, of all the situations where this could lead to a more efficient use of scarce resources, the best place to apply it is to your own spare time.If Burt Bacharach was right, there's a dearth of love in the world.

                      A suggestion for the very small charities working to do fundraising in your local communities: borrow a Karoke machine from a friend and hit the bars on Friday and Saturday nights. Then, invite people to Karoke by paying a small fee (which will go to your charity) for privilege of singing.Better yet, have people who want to sing set prices for how much it will cost to get them up on stage to sing a...

                      Usually musicals have songs and lyrics that are composed entirely for the musical, that fit into the flow of the story. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the music for The Phantom of the Opera, and the songs are a series of songs with words that all fit in the storyline. Story, then songs, in that order.Moulin Rouge was a whole different kind of musical. The songs in it were not written just for the movie; they...

                      I heard about a new toilet recently that opens as you approach it, has a heated seat, sprays and drys your bottom when your done, and has an MP3 player in it. That's not the most interesting part: in addition to all of that, it also analyzes your "leavings" and prepares a summary, which it then emails to your doctor. These toilets are gaining popularity in Japan.From a consumer standpoint, this is pretty easy to...

                      Earlier this month, I was driving across town with a friend of mine to see the movie Iron Man 2. My friend is an aficionado of comic book movies, so he had seen the first Iron Man and mentioned that he thought it was a great movie. En route, I confessed that I hadn't seen the first one and, so I wouldn't be completely lost while watching the sequel, I asked him to describe the...

                      When was the last time you were watching TV and you saw a commercial for a book? I don't watch a whole lot of TV, but it was a long time ago and I think it was for Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. Basically, a book that has mass, mass appeal.That begs the question: why don't more new books that comes out get a commercial? Why aren't there trailers or spots for books sandwiched between...
