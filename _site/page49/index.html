        If you're running a small grocery or convenience store, why is the cough medicine hidden in some random place back amongst the rest of the merchandise in your store? Think about the people who are coming into your store and looking for the DayQuil...they're probably:<br /><br />1. In a hurry to get what they came for and leave.<br />2. Infirm.<br /><br />Why sandwich this stuff in aisle 9 between the shampoo and soluble fiber? Sure, I know that's where the guys in the corporate office <em>told</em> you to put it in order to maximize ROI or whatever. Why not put it right at the front of the store, in a very obvious display shelf, so people who are miserable and sick with colds don't have to go digging for it? Given the opportunity to help those people get in and out quickly with what they need, why not make it as easy as possible?<br /><br />Besides pleasing customers, you're also ensuring that potentially contagious customers are not wandering around your store, coughing all over everything as they search for the Sudafed, and asking the clerks for assistance...increasing the risks that your employees will end up sick themselves.<br /><br />If you really want to minimize the amount of contact these sick people have with anyone in your store, if you can, put a vending machine containing the most popular cold remedies right by the entrance, much like they do with iPods in Macy's. That way, it's possible for someone to walk no more than 5 feet into your store, buy what they need, and leave without talking to anyone. <br /><br />If lines start forming at the vending machine, put free samples of Purell within reach. What would the CDC do?

        I'm talking about the game with the little spinning cage of balls and the cards with the letter-number combinations on them. Each player has a card, the person running the game picks a ball at random from the cage and calls it out, and if the player has that combination on their card, they cover it. Five covered squares in a row on a card is a winner.<br /><br />The one virtue of any game that is purely random and based entirely on the luck of the draw is egalitarian, but that's a shallow virtue to teach anyone to accept. Why sit back and wait for fortune to smile on you? In playing Bingo, there's little else you can do but sit on your hands and wait for luck to pay you off.<br /><br />That's no way to embrace a game, and it's no way to embrace life. Checkers might be a game of only two people, but at least it requires mental effort and strategy. Next time someone asks you to play Bingo, refuse. Then go buy a board game that gives you some measure of control over how well you perform at it.

        Of all the material things to which this maxim could apply, of all the situations where this could lead to a more efficient use of scarce resources, the best place to apply it is to your own spare time.<br /><br />If Burt Bacharach was right, there's a dearth of love in the world. But if there's one thing that there's just "too little of" for each of us, it's leisure time. And what we need is to make the most of what little we have.

        Would you take a music recommendation from someone that you hated? Would you consider listening to the iTunes playlist of someone you completely despised? Would you watch a movie if a personal enemy of yours told you it was good? Why or why not?<br /><br />Most of us would be inclined not only to <em>not</em> listen to the music of our enemies, but to strictly <em>avoid</em> listening to it at all costs. Even if we end up in a situation where we're forced to hear the songs, our brains will work hard to make sure that, no matter what, we don't end up <em>liking</em> them. And we'll make sure of it with all our might.<br /><br />Why is that? There are people that I don't like, and there are almost certainly people that despise me. But what does that have to do with the type of media we chose to consume? Nothing, really. I'm a person who is looking for interesting music...so is each of the people that I dislike.<br /><br />Even people that I like, but who I know to have "poor" taste in music, I'll go to great efforts to avoid admitting that I share their taste in music. These little cognitive biases play a huge role in determining what art we deem acceptable. This is silly. Nothing should preclude me from liking a song just because it happens to be a favorite of a person whose company I cannot stand.<br /><br />And yet, it matters...at least in my head.

        A suggestion for the very small charities working to do fundraising in your local communities: borrow a Karoke machine from a friend and hit the bars on Friday and Saturday nights. Then, invite people to Karoke by paying a small fee (which will go to your charity) for privilege of singing.<br /><br />Better yet, have people who want to sing set prices for how much it will cost to get them up on stage to sing a song of their choice, then rally everyone else in the bar to throw money into the pot to encourage them to do it. It might take thiry bucks to get George up on stage to butcher Erasure's "A Little Respect". See if you can get five bucks out of six people there to make it happen. Remind them it's all for charity. (And then, when George does it, buy him a beer for being a good sport.)<br /><br />I have no idea if anyone's ever done this, but if done correctly, with the right crowd of people, it could be lucrative. It's not the correct approach for the Red Cross, but for smaller organizations, it would be a welcome break from stuffy meetings in someone's basement.

        Usually musicals have songs and lyrics that are composed entirely for the musical, that fit into the flow of the story. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the music for <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, and the songs are a series of songs with words that all fit in the storyline. Story, then songs, in that order.<br /><br />Moulin Rouge was a whole different kind of musical. The songs in it were not written just for the movie; they were taken right from pop culture. Sure, they were arranged differently, performed by a symphony, so that there was continuity between the songs. But basically, the songs were plucked right from the radio. And the plot was worked to fit around the songs just as much as the songs fit into the plot. <br /><br />This was done in the eighteenth century in England by a man named John Gay, who wrote a play entitled <em>The Beggar's Opera</em>. It was notable for featuring music of the commoners, including many notable folk songs and church hymns, that were popular at the time. These were adopted to fit the story and worked into the opera as a whole.<br /><br />Creating a "beggar's opera" of your own sounds like an interesting idea for those looking to put on a production at their local theaters or churches. Most good songs have narrative in their lyrics, so it would be pretty easy to cobble several of them together around a plotline. The benefit? You don't have to write a bunch of music and the audience doesn't have to strain themselves getting acquainted with new melodies. Most of them will already know "Bad Romance", so when your angst-ridden protagonist starts belting out the words, it will strike a chord with onlookers immediately.

        I heard about a new toilet recently that opens as you approach it, has a heated seat, sprays and drys your bottom when your done, and has an MP3 player in it. That's not the most interesting part: in addition to all of that, it also analyzes your "leavings" and prepares a summary, which it then emails to your doctor. These toilets are gaining popularity in Japan.<br /><br />From a consumer standpoint, this is pretty easy to get excited about. An Internet-ready, MP3-playing, space-age shitter. People who own these have toilets that are equipped with better technology than my cell phone or car.<br /><br />What I wonder about, though, is the doctor that has to read all of these emails. I'm trying to picture that poor person (probably an intern or first-year resident, I'm guessing) sitting at a bar after work, making an effort to unwind, sipping a martini, talking about their day: "I get 600 emails a day about people's feces." Talk about paying your dues.<br /><br />I suppose it beats working at a sanitation plant.

        Earlier this month, I was driving across town with a friend of mine to see the movie <em>Iron Man 2</em>. My friend is an aficionado of comic book movies, so he had seen the first <em>Iron Man</em> and mentioned that he thought it was a great movie. En route, I confessed that I hadn't seen the first one and, so I wouldn't be completely lost while watching the sequel, I asked him to describe the plot of the first movie to me.<br /><br />I wasn't always willing to do this. When I was a lot younger, if you had tried to explain the plot of a movie to me before I saw it, I would have thrown up my hands to my ears and started humming, trying to keep you from spoiling anything about the movie. But I don't do that anymore, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, if I hear the plot of a movie, or get the twist ending leaked to me before I see it (can anyone say <em>Sixth Sense</em>?), and if that completely spoils the movie for me, then it probably wasn't a very good movie to begin with. It's the journey, not the destination.<br /><br />But second, and more importantly, I've learned that good experiences in life are not an exhaustible resource. If I have one movie ruined for me, there's lots of other movies out there that I can happily watch instead. And this lesson doesn't just apply to movies. There's always something else I can find to enjoy, whether it's a night out enjoying live music, taking a bike ride somewhere I've never been, or reading a really good book.<br /><br />Occasionally, the experience is ruined by some small factor or it's boring. That's okay...I've got plenty of tomorrows to try again.

        When was the last time you were watching TV and you saw a commercial for a book? I don't watch a whole lot of TV, but it was a long time ago and I think it was for Dan Brown's <em>The Lost Symbol</em>. Basically, a book that has mass, <em>mass</em> appeal.<br /><br />That begs the question: why don't more new books that comes out get a commercial? Why aren't there trailers or spots for books sandwiched between the "McCafe Your Day" and "Think Outside the Bun" messages that dominate commercial breaks?<br /><br />It may be because there's almost no overlap between the demographics that watch TV and those that read books. Or maybe there's just not enough money to be made from any one book to devote TV ad time to it. Books tend to have niche audiences, whereas Charmin Ultra can cost-effectively advertise on television simply because we <em>all</em> need toilet paper.<br /><br />Maybe the publishing industry is, and always was, ahead of its time. They recognize that people buy books based on something other than what an advertisement told them to. The last several dozen books I bought were based on word of mouth recommendations, trusted advice from people I respect, and Amazon cross-sells from other books I read and really liked. I've never seen a flyer for a book and thought, "I must read that."<br /><br />This is, I think, becoming truer for a lot of other industries and not just the book industry. People can have conversations about anything via social media, so the potential exists to give people something they love, and can talk about, instead of yelling at people through the boob tube. Commercials are faceless, impersonal, and irrelevant, which is why we're all so good at tuning them out.<br /><br />There may come a day when toilet paper is no longer an undifferentiated commodity produced by a national corporation. "Buy Local" could apply to toilet paper. If it were your company producing it, how would you start that conversation?

      <div class="content">
        In the world of business, the theory of constraints basically says that in any system, there is a small handful of bottlenecks that are keeping the system from reaching maximum efficiency. This applies to any business with a complicated manufacturing environment; according to the theory, there's bound to be something that's keep the output from getting higher. If you isolate and fix that problem, then you're golden.<br /><br />This applies at the individual level, but in a different way. We often need to <em>create</em> constraints for ourselves, not remove them. <br /><br />One example: whenever my girlfriend and I are on our way out to the coffee shop to read for an evening, I'll scan the dozens of unread books sitting on my shelves for one I should take with me to read. There's too many to choose from, so I'll often grab a backpack, pick five books that I might be interested in reading, and take them all with me. Later, when I get to the coffee shop, I still have trouble choosing from among the books which one I want to read. There's opportunity cost with each book: if I read one, then I can't read the other four.<br /><br />It's silly, but it's how we're wired. We're paralyzed by too many choices, whatever the situation. What does that mean for us in a world where you have so many different options for how you spend your time, so many ways you can express yourself and create art, how do you avoid getting overwhelmed? Constrain yourself. You could blog, or you could write that screenplay you've been thinking about, or you could write that fundraising letter, but which one do you pick? <br /><br />Ultimately, how you choose to constrain yourself, how you limit your choices in order to make the decision of what you should do today easier, is entirely up to you. Disconnect the Internet if you have to, so you won't be tempted to check your email. Turn off the TV and choose one book of the many to read. Eliminate options, focus your efforts, and follow through on the plan you choose.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't do nothing.
