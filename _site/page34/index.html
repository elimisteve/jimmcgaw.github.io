        Raising money for a non-profit is very, very hard work. We live in a world where the economy is governed by transactions. People give something, they get something in return. Usually this involves the exchange of goods, services, or currency.<br /><br />Asking people to donate money while getting nothing tangible in return, then, seems counter to what we expect. It doesn't feel right. And since we all have this feeling to some degree, even people working for charities have trouble asking for money.<br /><br />In the for-profit world, entrepreneurs play the venture capital game, all of them racing to launch the next big Internet start-up by pitching to investors for money. Simply being able to ask for money, and do it <em>well</em>, is considered a valuable skill...even as the costs of computing resources and software are falling all the time.<br /><br />And yet, it's a unique skill in the non-profit sector: selling. In fundraising for non-profits, the stakes are often much higher than in the tech sector. Sometimes, lives are on the line.<br /><br />I'd like to think it's more than just a transaction. Maybe it isn't just asking for money; maybe it's asking someone to see the world as you see it.

        Restaurants that take reservations have always had problems with no-shows. And on busy nights, when you have a lot of walk-ins, and you're juggling people showing up late for reservations or not at all, then it becomes a terrible headache to manage.<br /><br />So how do you make sure that people will let you know they're going to cancel their reservation instead of just abandoning it? Simple: ask.<br /><br />A study found that, after booking each reservation, if the hostess asked the caller, "If you need to cancel, will you please call us and let us know?" Just securing a simple "yes" to that question reduced the number of people who flaked out on their reservations. It's a small commitment, and getting people to verbally agree to it makes them feel obligated to follow through, one way or the other.<br /><br />We don't all work in restaurants or take reservations, but when was the last time someone didn't show up for an appointment with you?

        There a tremendous amount of power that lies in default choices. And so, the person who gets to control the default choice has a lot of power.<br /><br />Organ donation is opt-in in California. That means that when you register for a driver's license, if you do <em>nothing</em>, you don't get put onto the donor list. You have to check a box to say you'll participate in the program. So, because of inertia, the numbers are much lower than they would be if everyone were enrolled by default and they were required to check a box <em>not</em> to participate.<br /><br />In a lot of companies, employees don't get enrolled in the 401k or retirement programs automatically. In order to start withholding and contributing to the plans, the employee must elect to contribute. If they do nothing, they save nothing. The alternative to this is to enroll them in a plan by default and require them to elect to <em>stop</em> withholding.<br /><br />I'm not talking about being dishonest or deceitful. You call tell an employee fresh out of college, "Sign here; by default, we're enrolling you in our retirement program to save a modest part of each paycheck. You can stop this withholding at any time." Some of them will almost choose to opt out of withholding, either because they aren't thinking about retirement or because they want the money to buy that car they wanted since they were 15 years old.<br /><br />But many of them won't give it a second thought. They'll sign and be done with it, not really consider the ramifications. And by the time they realize that their employer has been socking money away for retirement for them, they'll probably have saved a large enough nest egg that they'll have trouble getting angry about it.<br /><br />There's a power in the default. Companies can help people save for their retirement, and states could help people save lives through organ donation programs, simply by changing where the masses of indifferent people end up.<br /><br />Libertarians oppose these kinds of measures, because they appear to remove choice. The impose a choice on each person, and they smell bad because they appear to decide what is best for that person. They're partly right; there's always a risk that policymakers will get it wrong. Maybe they won't end up doing what's best for people.<br /><br />Of course, you have to balance that against the fact that people won't always do what's best for themselves. Libertarians assume two things:<br /><br />1. People always have all the necessary information available to them to make an informed decision.<br /><br />2. Armed with all necessary information, people make decisions rationally.<br /><br />I can think of very few situations in the real world where both of these assumptions hold true. We're usually pretty ill-informed (even when we think we're not), and we don't act rationally (even when we think we do.)<br /><br />To be clear, I'm not talking about using defaults to get people to do things they don't want to do. It's mischievous that free credit report services will give you your credit score in exchange for enrolling in a monitoring service that's free for 30 days, then starts to bill you every month, unless you cancel. I'm not saying that scamming people is a good idea. Nor am I saying that people are dumb, or incapable of making decisions for themselves. But there's a powerful potential for influencing the decision merely by changing how you offer the choices. <br /><br />There's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X/">terrific book</a> written about this topic and its implications in our world. They discuss setting default choices, and nudging people in one direction or another, as <em>choice architecture</em>. At times, they implications far-reaching and large, but I think there are small chances for most of us to change the decision people make.<br /><br />The ladies at my orthodontist's office have two flavors of a particular paste they can mix to put into a person's mouth: strawberry and mint. The strawberry smells great when you're preparing it, mixes easier, and its bright color makes it easier to work with in a patient's mouth. The mint smells pretty bad when its being mixed and it's more transparent, making it harder to work with. People are given a choice between the two flavors. So, if you're working at that office, and the flavor people pick matters a great deal to you, and you want people to pick strawberry instead of mint, how do you push them in that direction?<br /><br />Hang up a sign with the two choices listed and an image next to each: the first is a high-quality pic of a strawberry being dunked into liquid chocolate, and the other is a grainy picture of a mint leaf against a backdrop of dirt. Which flavor would you choose? (Those ladies were nice enough to listen to my suggestion...but there was enough eye-rolling that I'm pretty sure they won't use my idea.)<br /><br />If you're a barista working in a coffee shop, and you've got a tip jar sitting out, isn't there a ton of things you could do that might draw people's attention to the tip jar? Or make them want to drop something into it?<br /><br />Some restaurants calculate 15% for tip and print it on the check so the patron can easily see it. I'd almost guarantee that this reduces the number of 20% tips a server gets from people. If the restaurant printed the amount of 25% on the check as a recommended tip, most people probably wouldn't leave that much, but I'm willing to bet that on average they'd leave <em>more</em> than when they were shown the 15% amount.<br /><br />First impressions are a mental anchor. Once people drop it, it's tough to take the boat down the river. (Sometimes, even with the current.) Make sure people are dropping it where you want.

        If a movie is really popular, sometimes you can buy the screenplay.<br /><br />It's neat. That means you can take a hard copy of a movie you really love to a coffee shop and read it. When I was a kid I took copies of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, <em>Clerks</em>, and <em>Swingers</em> on a road trip across the country with my parents.<br /><br />Reading the words and the brief descriptions of the scenes works really well when you've already seen the movie. In your mind, you have the end result to reference, so you have no trouble fleshing out the characters, their lines, or the visuals that add depth to the story.<br /><br />Going in the other direction is much harder. I've tried reading screenplays for movies that I haven't seen. If you ever try it, you'll see that it's very difficult to visualize what the writer had in mind. And when I end up seeing the movie, finally, the actual production is drastically different from what I had envisioned.<br /><br />Imagine having a stack of 15 or 20 screenplays and being charged with picking the one among them to greenlight. Filtering in this direction is tough. Even if you do pick the "best" screenplay of the lot, there's no telling that the director will execute the creation of the film well, or that it won't be miscast, etc.<br /><br />Lots of business books will tell you what Apple does well. His fanboys will point to all of the things that Obama did correctly in gathering support and winning the 2008 election. I've heard the motivational story of Jim Carrey writing himself a check for $1 million for "Acting Services Rendered" when he was in poverty and then being able to cash that check a few years later, after striking it big in Hollywood.<br /><br />These stories are great, and they probably contain better wisdom than the analysis of all their failed comrades. But that doesn't mean being a copycat, and using their means as your own roadmap, will lead to any kind of success. By definition, once there <em>is</em> a roadmap, it's probably not a worthwhile road to travel.<br /><br />(Hint: don't attend any large seminar entitled "How To Make Millions".)

        I'm not a big fan of going to the movies. This is a pretty common trend among young people...the experience of going to the theater and paying $10 to see a film ($13 if you have to see it in the obligatory 3-D) is not really worth it. Having to sit for two hours in an uncomfortable seat, possibly surrounded by loud people, and devoting all of your attention, undivided, to a movie that might end up being a waste of money.<br /><br />People in my generation are more likely to be doing exactly what I'm doing: sitting at home with the television on, Netflix streaming into the box, with a laptop perched on my legs. I'm multitasking. Even with the TV on, I'm usually toying around on Facebook, writing music, or doing something else at the same time.<br /><br />And yet, as painful as immersing yourself into a film experience can be (when the movie is really, really terrible), there's something unique about the feeling of emerging from it. I suspect most people see movies in theaters close to home; it's odd to walk out of a dark theater and step back into the real world. The process of adjusting from the fantasy to reality, where immersion is total, gives us new perspective on the world around us. I always feel like my brain is being rewired and tweaked in subtle ways as I struggle to reconcile the movie experience with my own life. I almost <em>never</em> get that from watching a DVD at home.<br /><br />Worth $10? That I'm not sure of. Maybe I just need to turn down the lights and turn off the laptop and the DVD will have the same effect.

        I was walking through Borders the other day and I overheard an old lady asking one of the employees if they had a book in stock called "Shit My Dad Says". (It was little strange to hear an older woman asking a bookstore clerk for the title.) I had heard of the idea before: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shitmydadsays">guy on Twitter</a> in his early 30's lives with his parents, and starts sharing the stuff that his grumpy old dad says. It started out as a pretty big hit in social media, and eventually, the content was released as a book.<br /><br />There are other Internet sensations that became books. <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">icanhascheezeburger</a> (a.k.a. LOLCats) is another example. And then there's <a href="http://awkwardfamilyphotos.com/">Awkward Family Photos</a>. The interesting thing about these books is that their contents are available online. And for free. So why on earth do people buy books containing stuff they could get on the Internet without paying for them?<br /><br />The answer is simple, but a lot of people struggle with it, and it's worth exploring if you're ever planning to write a book. The creators of these books used a website to build an audience first. Then, and only after there was an audience, did the book get published. People buy the paper version once they fall in love with the idea of the book. <br /><br />In essence, the ideas came first, and the hard copy of the book itself is <em>memorabilia</em>. <br /><br />There's a few reasons why so many people own all the <em>Harry Potter</em> books...they're fun (or easy) to read; a human compulsion to keep a collection complete (you have to own them all); keeping up with the Joneses (people buy bestsellers because they're bestsellers, and so the cycle continues). But sitting on a person's bookshelf, the books themselves represent more to the person than the words they contain. They're closer to the proverbial snow globe you buy on vacation, whose role is closer to remembrance than utility.<br /><br />If you see it this way, then giving away your writing on a blog or as free Amazon Kindle books starts to make much more sense.

        A few weekends ago, I discovered that it's remarkably easy to record spooky-sounding, gothic Halloween music, so I wrote and recorded an album of about 20 songs in roughly a week. I was interested in going through the whole process of creating and releasing an album in our digital world, so I resolved to get the album out by the end of the month. Shortly after I finished burning off most of the auditory warts from the final product, I submitted the finished product to Amazon MP3 to be sold as digital downloads. <br /><br />Two weeks later (just in time for Halloween), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scary-As-Really-Thing/dp/B004A21KVC/">album is up on Amazon</a> available for purchase. (Note: if you're reading this you can download the whole thing for free on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Autumn-Abandon/104863876245971">project's Facebook page</a>.)<br /><br />I have no delusions about this. It's not the greatest album ever written; I originally codenamed the project "The Litany" as a joking reference to how repetitive some of the songs are. The album isn't breaking any musical boundaries and it's not discernibly better than anything else you could buy. I'm pretty sure the project's Amazon page will get a few visitors, who will listen to the 30-second samples, smile politely, and then leave. It will fall between the cracks and will disappear into obscurity as easily as it was created. So, if I knew that all along, why did I bother doing all the work?<br /><br />Simple: because I could.<br /><br />Me: I think the citation of "because I could" is perfectly defensible. It's a reason a lot of people hate to hear, because effort for its own sake is the mark of the amateur. There are always reasons not to do things, reasons that lots of people choose to live by, but I think the recognition and acceptance of your own capability are powerful things, and any action that derives from them is even more so. <br /><br />I'm old enough to remember a time 20 years ago when, if you wanted to record music, but you didn't have a lot of time or money, there was a limit to what you could produce. And even if you could produce it, you were limited in how you could share it. It's old news now, but the rules surrounding the whole music business have been slowly dying off thanks to the Internet.<br /><br />And with so many rules gone, I look at the new game, I see all the possibilities and think, "Wheeeee! I like this game! Let's play!"<br /><br />Happy Halloween.

        There's an extermination service in my town that sends its servicemen out in pickup trucks with giant plastic black widow spiders on the doors on either side of the car. More than once, one of these trucks pulled up next to me at an intersection and, after glimpsing the outline of a giant black spider out of the corner of my eye, scared the bejesus out of me.<br /><br />Human beings, it turns out, are more deeply afraid of spiders, scorpions, and snakes than most other things. We learn to be afraid of handguns, because at a rational level, we know these devices are capable of killing us, and we've been conditioned to be afraid. But a fear of spiders is ingrained in people at an evolutionary level. It's wired into our DNA, so that knee-jerk reaction from seeing the spider on our leg comes from the limbic system, automatically, just like touching a hot pan. Just the shape of a spider is enough to speed up one's pulse.<br /><br />Turns out giant scary spiders are good branding for an exterminator. I hate to encourage this, but if I'm ever unlikely enough to have my place infested with bugs and I need to hire an exterminator, the spider truck guys are the only ones I can think of by name. They're lucky enough to have a business based on something primal, like food or pornography.

        A couple of weeks ago, a co-worker of mine starting complaining about one of the local newspapers, referring to it in very polite terms as a "shit-rag". <br /><br />I laughed at this comment, and replied, "Well, in my experience, all newspapers are shit-rags." I was being facetious, and I was talking more about the medium of print than the role of journalism in society as a whole. But, my co-worker took this comment very personally, largely due to the fact that he used to work for several years at a newspaper. He proceeded to launch into a long diatribe about the purpose of a newspaper, what it's supposed to accomplish both locally and globally, etc. And I have to admit that as he spoke, I started to tune him out, as I often do when I'm speaking to someone who goes off half-cocked.<br /><br />Every academic field is supposed to serve a purpose in society. People study their respective disciplines in college so they can start playing that role when they graduate. There's no such thing as an inherently moral or immoral academic field; the actions of those graduates, which may ultimately form the impression people have of those fields, is what makes them seem so.<br /><br />In the case of journalism, a few greedy people with an agenda make the whole industry seem corrupt. A few advertisers peddle cigarettes and this ruins people's faith in advertising for advertisers trying to sell diapers. Arthur Andersen colludes with Enron to bilk shareholders out of a ton of money and suddenly the credibility of every last CPA is called into question.<br /><br />For any profession, public trust is an important resource, and most professionals are aware of this fact. They act accordingly. But a few bad apples at the fringes ruin things for everyone. And so, having been exposed to enough misuse of journalism in my days, and because the misuses stick out in my mind more than the benefits, my irrational inclination is to think less of it.<br /><br />The solution to this problem is just to recognize that this is the way things are and that overgeneralizing doesn't narrow down the actual problem. Maybe we should stop pretending that we can solve the world's problems by hating large parts of it in broad strokes.

        In my experience, most companies that use blogs to promote themselves are getting it wrong. The reason is simple: try to imagine reading a newspaper where all the articles are written about what's happening at that newspaper's headquarters. Would anyone read that?
