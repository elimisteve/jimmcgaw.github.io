                      Raising money for a non-profit is very, very hard work. We live in a world where the economy is governed by transactions. People give something, they get something in return. Usually this involves the exchange of goods, services, or currency.Asking people to donate money while getting nothing tangible in return, then, seems counter to what we expect. It doesn't feel right. And since we all have this feeling to some degree, even people working for...

                      Restaurants that take reservations have always had problems with no-shows. And on busy nights, when you have a lot of walk-ins, and you're juggling people showing up late for reservations or not at all, then it becomes a terrible headache to manage.So how do you make sure that people will let you know they're going to cancel their reservation instead of just abandoning it? Simple: ask.A study found that, after booking each reservation, if the...

                      If a movie is really popular, sometimes you can buy the screenplay.It's neat. That means you can take a hard copy of a movie you really love to a coffee shop and read it. When I was a kid I took copies of Pulp Fiction, Clerks, and Swingers on a road trip across the country with my parents.Reading the words and the brief descriptions of the scenes works really well when you've already seen the...

                      I'm not a big fan of going to the movies. This is a pretty common trend among young people...the experience of going to the theater and paying $10 to see a film ($13 if you have to see it in the obligatory 3-D) is not really worth it. Having to sit for two hours in an uncomfortable seat, possibly surrounded by loud people, and devoting all of your attention, undivided, to a movie that might...

                      I was walking through Borders the other day and I overheard an old lady asking one of the employees if they had a book in stock called "Shit My Dad Says". (It was little strange to hear an older woman asking a bookstore clerk for the title.)

                      A few weekends ago, I discovered that it's remarkably easy to record spooky-sounding, gothic Halloween music, so I wrote and recorded an album of about 20 songs in roughly a week. I was interested in going through the whole process of creating and releasing an album in our digital world, so I resolved to get the album out by the end of the month. Shortly after I finished burning off most of the auditory warts...

                      There's an extermination service in my town that sends its servicemen out in pickup trucks with giant plastic black widow spiders on the doors on either side of the car. More than once, one of these trucks pulled up next to me at an intersection and, after glimpsing the outline of a giant black spider out of the corner of my eye, scared the bejesus out of me.Human beings, it turns out, are more deeply...

                      A couple of weeks ago, a co-worker of mine starting complaining about one of the local newspapers, referring to it in very polite terms as a "shit-rag". I laughed at this comment, and replied, "Well, in my experience, all newspapers are shit-rags."
