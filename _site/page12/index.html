        Went to go see a concert last night, but when we got to the show, it was sold out. My friend and I walked around West Hollywood to find a good place to eat, and we stumbled across a steakhouse that contained, among other things, a mechanical bull.<br /><br />The novelty drew us in, but I became a fan for one simple reason: the service. The manager was making the rounds getting to know the patrons, making good conversation (which was a far cry from the bland "How is everything?" you get at Chili's), and the servers were all very attentive and polite. All of this on a Friday night in a packed steakhouse where almost everyone was stumbling around with a drink in hand.<br /><br />On our way out, I pulled the manager aside and told him, as quickly as I could, "I know this job can't be easy. And I'll bet you get to hear all about things from customers when they aren't going well. But, I have to tell you that you and everyone here did a <em>great</em> job this evening. Thank you."<br /><br />He was clearly very happy to get the compliment. I share the story not because I'm interested in demonstrating what a swell guy I am. (I have my good moments, and my bad ones, I'm sure.) I offer it because I firmly believe that if human behavior is going to change for the better, in any situation, no matter how small or large, then you praise the good and you let the bad roll off your back without uttering a syllable. Reinforce the positive! Pay no mind to the negative, it'll pass!<br /><br />To those interested: I'm taking a brief hiatus from writing on here to manage the aforementioned <a href="http://kck.st/kaSq87">Kickstarter project</a>. We have a ways to go money-wise, but we've managed to get quite a few pledgers who seem to really want a Swoop the Owl. The way I see it, I'm in their debt and on the hook for making it happen, so that's getting as much of my time as I can spare right now.<br /><br />To all backers: thank you! I hope not to let you down.

        There is a story that has come to my attention from several different people. (It takes place in Texas, and I don't know a soul in Texas.) Quick question: what do you do when you're running a movie theater, and ticket sales have been falling? <br /><br />The answer is likely "better marketing". And how do you do that? By taking a stand. By drawing a line in the sand. And that might involve <a href="http://cf.drafthouse.com/she_texted_we_kicked_her_out2.html">publicly firing some of your worst customers</a>.<br /><br />They might take it personally. Let them. It's called "positioning" for a reason, and people have been doing it for decades because it works if you do it right.

        It's no secret that technology has rapidly outpaced the privacy laws governing it in the past couple of decades.<br /><br />Privacy <em>policies</em>, on the other hand, are often better spelled out on websites. Sure, they're often way too long for a person to read through, and they often contain unintelligible gobs of legalese, but at least they are <em>available</em> to anyone who cares to read them.<br /><br />I popped a question yesterday online about those "contest jars" that take business cards by cash registers...if you're tossing away someone else's business card, why not enter them into a contest for a free lunch?<br /><br />An astute friend pointed out that companies often sponsor these so they can collect people's data for spamming purposes.<br /><br />I believe him, but the thought didn't occur to me, because this <em>wasn't posted anywhere</em>. There is no "terms of use" for this jar. I'll concede that people are opting in because they're giving up their business card, but they're doing so without the whole story. And an opt-in based on incomplete information isn't consensual, so it's still spam.<br /><br />I often attend functions for charity that require me to sign in. Along with my name, they also ask for my email address. In these situations, I'm generally more shrewd and ask the person attending the event what my email will be used for. Usually they shrug; "I just work here", in other words.<br /><br />If there's no good reason for them to have my email, I don't offer it.<br /><br />It's much harder to spell out in plain text how you're going to use someone's information if you're capturing it offline in the real world. And it's generally impossible to obfuscate your real intentions by burying it in heaps of text. (Offline, people will get suspicious and just leave.) But that doesn't give you the right to offer no information and then use it without consent. Offline privacy law seems to have its hiccups, too.

Play with it a for a little while, it's amazing. I'll be here when you get back (if you can tear yourself away.)<br /><br />About it, Rick said, "This is inspiring. You create something, so that people can make something beautiful out of it."<br /><br />Well said. Most people build successes not by creating something awesome, but by creating something that enables other people to be awesome.

        Marketing advice that I got second-hand from the Advanced Search Engine Optimization conference, in a nutshell:<br /><br /><em>If you want to get a thousand fans on Facebook really quickly and cheaply, start running ads in a foreign country that has an extremely low GDP. The ads cost less per click and people's Facebook pages haven't been saturated there yet.</em><br /><br />This isn't bad advice if you want 1,000 Facebook fans, pronto. But it also illustrates the supreme futility of playing the numbers game. Sure, you end up with a bunch of faux fans, but what does that really translate into? (Maybe it looks good on an executive summary for an investor, but that's about it.)<br /><br />Having followers doesn't mean you have a following. And a following, while it takes longer to build, is infinitely more valuable.

        My check engine light came on the other day. This is the first time this has happened since I jumped onto the yuppie bandwagon and purchased an iPhone for myself.<br /><br />As I opened the trunk to get out my OBDII code reader, I immediately thought to myself: "Why hasn't someone created this idea for iPhones?" The earphone jack on the iPhone can take raw binary data as an input (this is how the <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> app works), so why not create the ability for the car to dump its error codes onto the iPhone and have an app tell you what they mean?<br /><br />Of course, I did some googling, and there are a few people who have done something like this. But my real question when I have an idea that sounds new usually isn't "Why hasn't someone done this?", but instead "Why hasn't the person who <em>is</em> doing this managed to bring it to my attention?"

        I went looking for a good scary movie to watch last October on Netflix. You'd think this would be easy, since they have a massive online repository of movies you can rent, and it spans just about everything that's ever been released on DVD. I started with one horror movie I had heard of, then started leaping through the recommended similar movies.<br /><br />You'd think this would take me down a pretty big rabbit hole. But I ended up seeing the same few dozen movies over and over again. Even if I went back and started with a different movie on the fringes, I would always eventually wind up seeing the same few dozen movies again. <br /><br />There's probably a good reason for this, and I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that Netflix makes more money on people who just watching streaming movies on Instant Play as opposed to people who get the movies in the mail, which require a physical copy of the DVD that must be purchased, then mailed each time. So, they've probably architected their system to steer people towards the movies they have available to watch instantly.<br /><br />People regard software as being impersonal and soulless. 99% of the time, if the business people and programming people are communicating effectively, it isn't. There's usually some logic that's intended to push people in one direction or another.

        I spent four years in college learning accounting which, in summary (to spare you the gory details), basically means I spent four years learning "the equation":<br /><br />Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity<br /><br />It sounds fancy, but it isn't. The sum total of a company is what's owned plus what's owed. If you have a company worth $100, but $50 of that is on a credit card, it means half of the company is leveraged.<br /><br />This makes for a great snapshot of the worth of a company is at any given point in time. When you look at how it performed in a certain period, you turn to the income statement. Sales - Cost = Profit, in a nutshell. That's the income statement.<br /><br />As far as the accounting equation goes, there is no equivalent expression for the income statement. Personally, I think there should be. One simple reason: in every sale a company makes, there <em>is</em> a liability. There's a debt. Maybe it's one of gratitude, but the customer is behind the sale. It doesn't matter how much work went into the sale...the customer made the decision, and the company has a liability. It has a debt. It has an obligation.<br /><br />It's when companies forget this simple fact, and start playing tricks with the numbers, that they start getting into big trouble.

        I imagine that Lorne Michaels gets a lot of email.<br /><br />Maybe not him personally, but his office. And I'll bet it comes from group of people who are all claiming to be "the next 'Lonely Island'".<br /><br />The Lonely Island, for those who don't know, is Andy Sandberg's trio that started making comedy songs out of an apartment and ended up getting featured on Saturday Night Live a few years ago. They're quite famous now.<br /><br />Naturally, along with any kind of notoriety comes the rush to copy. So I'm guessing there are tons of comedy duos and trios making videos in an effort to get discovered by someone in the media industry. There are a couple of problems with this:<br /><br />1. The rags-to-riches story of The Lonely Island is one that other people tell about them. To my knowledge, they don't go around telling it about themselves.<br /><br />2. It was an interesting story when it happened to The Lonely Island because <em>it hadn't happened before</em>. <br /><br />Three amateurs getting discovered by Lorne Michaels and joining the Saturday Night Live lineup is a pretty good story, but these kinds of things wear on people. If you hear a remarkable story, whether it's group-based discounts (Groupon), online video hosting (YouTube), or social networking (Facebook), the truth is this: once that story has been told, it's taken, so it's no longer interesting when you decide to tell your own it.<br /><br />This is why imitation rarely works. It's tempting to copy someone else who's made it because, hey, it worked for them. But very few people copy their way into greatness.

        There's a group of people out there who are interested in what you have to say.<br /><br />It's no secret that like-minded people come together and hang out with each other. And these clumps of people, even if they are distributed across multiple cities or even countries, are determined to find each other and connect.<br /><br />Somewhere out there, there is a group of people who want to hear what you say. There's a clump waiting for your message. It might not be a huge clump. Maybe it's just 10 people in just as many states, but they're anxious to hear from you. And they're so anxious that they might even pay for the privilege.<br /><br />I write a lot of posts on here that say something to the effect of "the Internet makes everything easy for the rest of us." It takes a lot of forms, but what I basically mean is that the Internet allows anyone to do 3 things:<br /><br />1. Find out if an audience exists.<br /><br />2. Determine whether or not this audience can be reached.<br /><br />3. Figure out how to connect with them.<br /><br />Nike didn't just start selling running shoes 30 years ago. There was a latent group of running enthusiasts that Nike spoke to, and that brought people out, and brought people together. Even if there never was an annual convention where they all congregated, everyone who bought the shoes became a part of something. Call it self-expression via consumption, if you'd like.<br /><br />This phenomena works when you're able to reach the audience in a cost-effective way. Granted, most of us don't have Nike's budget and can't spend billions on advertising to the masses. My solution: don't start by saying something that's meant to be heard by the masses. Pick a niche and speak to them. And (thanks to the Internet) you don't need millions in order to say it.<br /><br />What makes a rock band or musical act work is when the audience for the music comes together. Marilyn Manson didn't invent white goth kids in grade school. He just figured they were out there and started performing, giving them a place to hang out in their city where they might not be judged for their odd attire. (And, yes, he sold a few million albums...but that's the cart after the horse.)<br /><br />The fact that what you're saying has been said before is a poor excuse. Very little is said, and very few things are produced, that are completely novel and new. Things get recycled, usually inadvertently, as a natural part of the creative process.<br /><br />Maybe your audience won't like what you say as much as how <em>you</em> say it. <br /><br />There's something that you want to offer. I can't say what it is, because I might not know you, but you have something to tell people, sell people, or to make people <em>feel</em>. There's something you can make people experience.<br /><br />If you're not out there, put yourself out there. Make yourself discoverable. Let the audience find you if you can't find them. But I know that they're out there, ready to listen to you, if you reach for them.
