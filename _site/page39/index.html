                      Activity doesn't equal accomplishment, but the former necessarily comes before the latter. Figuring out exactly what you want to accomplish is easier while taking action. Worthwhile accomplishments are often only recognizable to hindsight. Foresight bias is usually predicated on the fear of criticism, and that only serves to keep us from doing important things.

                      The two sound functionally equivalent, but they're actually quite different. The distinction lies in the intent of the searcher. You find something when you seek out a particular thing and successfully locate it. You discover something while browsing, and you come across something you weren't necessarily looking for.Columbus discovered America while he was in the process of trying to find India.Making something easy to find isn't quite as easy as it sounds.

                      I met a woman from Denmark earlier this week who's currently working in the United States as a consultant to businesses. According to her, she helps people prepare Powerpoint presentations. In her words, she tries to make them "more visually striking and not just full of lots and lots of text". Who knew you could do that for a living? And I was glad to hear it, because anyone who's had the misfortune of spending...

                      They start with the first person who chooses to stand up and follow that leader. Until that happens, there is no movement, just a person with an idea, and without followers, they're not a leader.A lot of us are sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike, for that perfect idea to champion, so we can stand up and start leading people.

                      Whenever we're in social situations with strangers, like at parties or seated on a plane, the first question we tend to ask one another is "What do you do?" This is surprisingly pervasive in our culture, and I'm told that it's a less common question to ask in other places in the world. The implication, of course, is that we're defined in large part by what we choose to do for a living.The problem with...

                      About 100 years ago, Sir Francis Galton took an ox into a marketplace and asked lots of people to guess how many pounds the ox weighed. The individual guesses came from a diverse sampling of people, who weren't educated, and it was Galton's intention to demonstrate that the guesses of a few people would be close to the actual weight of the ox, while most of them would be way off the mark.The guesses did...

                      One thing that I've discovered to be immensely helpful in writing is the process of coming away from a difficult situation and trying to find the positive in it. I write on here once a day, which means that I treat every interaction I have with the world as an opportunity to find something interesting, to uncover some insight for myself, so that maybe I'll be able to distill something worth sharing. Time is short,...

                      Politically, my mother is a fairly liberal person, the kind that (probably) voted for Obama, and my father is a much more conservative, Rush Limbaugh-listening Republican type. This can lead to interesting conversations that start to bubble up during the holidays, but the more important implication is that it's impossible for anyone talking to me to make broad, incendiary statements about Republicans or Democrats without indirectly insulting one of my parents. This usually doesn't bother...

                      On a day that's not anywhere close to New Year's, I figured I'd go back and review my own resolution from last January and see just how much progress I had made. In doing so, I started thinking about resolutions in general. Very often, people set out to stop smoking, stop drinking, stop eating so much, or eliminate any other number of bad habits. These types of goals tend to be much harder when they...

                      I took my car into a mechanic recently and, no surprise, turns out there's a lot that's wrong with it, and a lot of things that need fixing. Nothing urgent, they tell me, but if anything ever goes wrong, the insinuation is that I'll only have myself to blame...The problem with these kinds of situations is that the person who's giving us advice is also the person that has something to sell us.
