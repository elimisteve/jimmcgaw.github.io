        Activity doesn't equal accomplishment, but the former necessarily comes before the latter. Figuring out exactly what you want to accomplish is easier while taking action. <br /><br />Worthwhile accomplishments are often only recognizable to hindsight. Foresight bias is usually predicated on the fear of criticism, and that only serves to keep us from doing important things.

        The two sound functionally equivalent, but they're actually quite different. The distinction lies in the intent of the searcher. You <em>find</em> something when you seek out a particular thing and successfully locate it. You <em>discover</em> something while browsing, and you come across something you weren't necessarily looking for.<br /><br />Columbus <em>discovered</em> America while he was in the process of trying to <em>find</em> India.<br /><br />Making something easy to find isn't quite as easy as it sounds. I had a friend post a comment and a link a few days ago saying "OkThink is a great blog to read." So at some point, with nothing better to do, I fired up Google and typed in "ok think". Didn't find it. Tried "okthink", all together, and still didn't find it. They have a name, but you can't find them easily because the terms are too vague. (Perhaps they're a new site.)<br /><br />If you search for my name, Jim McGaw, there are similar problems. I'm not the only Jim McGaw out there; there are at least four others who have a web presence, and one of them even has a blog which he calls "Jim McGaw's Blog". That, and I don't have a particularly great name; most people who don't know me very well try to spell my last name as McGraw, since that's more common. So because I'm not that distinct and because I'm not easy to remember or spell, I'm not very findable by large sums of strangers. (I happen to be okay with this because as far as my day-to-day routine is concerned, this blog is something of an afterthought.)<br /><br />There are other caveats to findability, but those are a couple of the main ones, and the web is rife with people stumbling over them. <br /><br />Discovery is a much more interesting process. Influential people with large audiences are able to help people discover things. Oprah is the perfect example of this. If she reads a book, loves it, and it makes her book club, millions of people suddenly get introduced to a book they weren't looking for and they read it because of their trust and faith in Oprah's celebrity status. And that doesn't mean the books aren't good (Dr. Phil McGraw, one man who's probably more responsible than any other for people misspelling my name, might be an exception), but all those people wouldn't have discovered the books on their own.<br /><br />Amazon's quite good at this. If you go on Amazon looking to find something specific, you'll find it, but I can't tell you how many times I've gone onto Amazon, typed in a vague phrase or idea, and ended up discovering some book that's loosely related to the original idea that I end up buying.<br /><br />Social media is a great tool for discovery. The only reason I made any effort to find the OkThink blog is because a friend on Facebook led me to discover it.<br /><br />Why does this distinction matter, and why should anyone care? The Internet is still a fairly new invention, and search is still very much in its infancy. Sure, no new search engine is going to displace Google anytime soon, but that doesn't mean they have the problem completely worked out. Google is a search engine. Bing has recently emerged and been branded as a "decision engine" (because, you know, we need computers to <em>decide</em> things for us....thanks Microsoft.) But what about a <em>discovery</em> engine? If you built that site, what exactly would it look like and how would it work?<br /><br />Trying to compete with Google and Bing might be a bad idea (?), but there's absolutely no shortage of need or demand for discovery engines on the Web. Search might be hitting puberty at this point, but discovery is not a solved problem; not by a long shot. In virtually every area, there's the potential to introduce more serendipity, and create more seemingly random but sensible connections between things. Even if someone's already doing it, it can be done better. This is a wellspring of opportunity that, from a technology standpoint, we've only just begun to tap.<br /><br />Over the next ten years, I'm anxious to see just how far down the iceberg goes.

        I met a woman from Denmark earlier this week who's currently working in the United States as a consultant to businesses. According to her, she helps people prepare Powerpoint presentations. In her words, she tries to make them "more visually striking and not just full of lots and lots of text". Who knew you could do that for a living? And I was glad to hear it, because anyone who's had the misfortune of spending lots of time in the business world knows how painful it is when a speaker throws up Powerpoint slides and just <em>reads</em> from them the whole time. If you can do that and get your point across, why didn't you just send me an email? Sheesh.<br /><br />Usually, when I meet a police officer, firefighter, or teacher, I thank them for what they do for a living, because they're making the world a better place. This might be the first time I've ever thanked a business consultant for doing what they do.

        They start with the first person who chooses to stand up and follow that leader. Until that happens, there is no movement, just a person with an idea, and without followers, they're not a leader.<br /><br />A lot of us are sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike, for that perfect idea to champion, so we can stand up and start leading people. We're waiting for that "dare to be great" opportunity to cross our paths, so we can go down in history as the PERSON WHO DID THAT HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT THING.<br /><br />We all know the name Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and while he accomplished a great deal as a leader, I'd be hard-pressed to accept the notion that he did it on his own. He undoubtedly had help and support from a great many people under him, who were following his direction and pitching in when it came to the details. <br /><br />And while this sounds less appealing in theory, really good followers have initiative, which makes them leaders in their own right. Think of them as sub-leaders. And spending time in that role, anywhere, is a much better way to learn how to lead than sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike.

        Whenever we're in social situations with strangers, like at parties or seated on a plane, the first question we tend to ask one another is "What do you do?" This is surprisingly pervasive in our culture, and I'm told that it's a less common question to ask in other places in the world. The implication, of course, is that we're defined in large part by what we choose to do for a living.<br /><br />The problem with this is that I remember being 19, in college, and a college advisor put his proverbial gun to my head and ordered me to pick a major, lest I not graduate in four years' time. This at a time when I had barely figured out who I was or where I fit into the world, and I was supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my <em>life</em>. Talk about pressure. I've spoken to lots of people since then who have told me they had a very similar experience. So how is it that a decision made by many people in haste, out of necessity, is something that we let determine who we are?<br /><br />It's a good first question to ask strangers: What do you do when you're <em>not</em> at work? That question tends to get people talking enthusiastically, and the answers are almost always more interesting than those to questions about work. Sure, I do meet people who like what they do for a living, and that's pretty refreshing when it happens, but there's usually more passion in what people are doing in their off hours.<br /><br />Are you delighted to talk about the work you do when you aren't at work? It's a good question to ask yourself on a Monday morning as we get back to the grind.<br /><br />(P.S. Friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky...does that mean Monday the 13th is lucky?)

        About 100 years ago, Sir Francis Galton took an ox into a marketplace and asked lots of people to guess how many pounds the ox weighed. The individual guesses came from a diverse sampling of people, who weren't educated, and it was Galton's intention to demonstrate that the guesses of a few people would be close to the actual weight of the ox, while most of them would be way off the mark.<br /><br />The guesses did range far and wide, but what he found, surprisingly, was that when he took the average of all the guesses, they were off by a single pound. And while it would be easy to bill that as a happy coincidence, Galton's experience was not an isolated phenomenon. It's come to be known as the "wisdom of crowds", and lots of examples of this are documented in James Surowiecki's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385721706/">book of the same name</a>.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but the premise of the wisdom of crowds concept originally made me gnash my teeth. From both intro Psych classes and bitter experience, I've learned that group dynamics don't tend to result in more intelligent conclusions being reached. As Tommy Lee Jones put it in <em>Men in Black</em>: "A person is smart; people are dumb."<br /><br />But there's a critical distinction to point out here: Galton had each person guess how much the ox weighed individually. This is important. If Galton had gathered a large group of people together and said, "Now, all of you, discuss amongst yourselves how much this ox weighs until you all reach a consensus", well, that would have been an <em>entirely</em> different situation. Chances are good that, given the opportunity to argue and bicker with each other, that crowd of people would have come up with a really bad guess as to the ox's weight. <br /><br />Instead, everyone made their own guess, based on their own personal judgment, without being swayed by anyone else. As long as each person is acting <em>independently</em>, and you aggregate their knowledge, then the wisdom of crowds works.<br /><br />Shortly after reading the book, I got to wondering if this could be applied to weather. The old joke is that the weatherman is one of the few jobs where you can be wrong 90% of the time and maintain steady employment. And, of course, that we have lots of expensive doo-hickeys called satellites flying around the Earth, but we can't tell when it's going to rain as well as a herd of cows can.<br /><br />What if you asked <em>everyone</em> for a guess about tomorrow's weather? Ask them for the high and low temperature, and a guess about conditions through the day. If you averaged all those guesses together, how accurate would it be?<br /><br />I was interested in getting an answer to this question, so I clobbered together a website called <a href="http://www.weathercollective.com/">Weather Collective</a> (with some help from my girlfriend) that aims to figure out if the crowd can guess tomorrow's weather. For now, we've set it up with about two dozen cities in the U.S., just to see what happens. If you're interesting in participating, please <a href="http://www.weathercollective.com/accounts/register/">feel free to register</a> and start making guesses along with us.<br /><br />Like most new websites, getting all the features fully in place is going to be an iterative process, so please forgive any bugs you encounter. All feedback is welcome. Thanks!

        One thing that I've discovered to be immensely helpful in writing is the process of coming away from a difficult situation and trying to find the positive in it. I write on here once a day, which means that I treat every interaction I have with the world as an opportunity to find something interesting, to uncover some insight for myself, so that maybe I'll be able to distill something worth sharing. Time is short, so it's immensely important that I don't squander any of those opportunities by letting myself get mired into emotional traps.<br /><br />A lot of the posts that I've written on here have been the direct product of a social encounter or an email interaction with a stranger that left me confused, annoyed, or even frustrated with the other person. Sure, it would be easy for me to get mad at someone who cuts in front of me in line at the grocery store and write about that, but I can't just come on here and start whining about how annoying people are. That wouldn't be interesting, and it would be immensely counter-productive for me as a person to expound on negative emotions. And I'm definitely not the only person who's short on time during my days.<br /><br />If you're going to write something on the Internet, you always have to stop and consider whether what you're about to write is really worth spreading. Moods are contagious, and words are powerful contagions. And one thing I've learned is that most people in this world don't need any help learning how to become negative thinkers.

        Politically, my mother is a fairly liberal person, the kind that (probably) voted for Obama, and my father is a much more conservative, Rush Limbaugh-listening Republican type. This can lead to interesting conversations that start to bubble up during the holidays, but the more important implication is that it's impossible for anyone talking to me to make broad, incendiary statements about Republicans or Democrats without indirectly insulting one of my parents. <br /><br />This usually doesn't bother me when it happens...but most other people have family or friends of varying political persuasions, and it could almost certainly bother any one of <em>them</em>. It's clear that a lot of people don't keep this sort of thing in mind when they start talking politics in social situations.<br /><br />You have to be careful what you say, and how you say it, because you never really know exactly who you're talking to. (P.S. That advice doesn't just apply to politics.)

        On a day that's not anywhere close to New Year's, I figured I'd go back and review my own resolution from last January and see just how much progress I had made. In doing so, I started thinking about resolutions in general. Very often, people set out to stop smoking, stop drinking, stop eating so much, or eliminate any other number of bad habits. These types of goals tend to be much harder when they involve quitting without the adoption of any kind of replacement behavior.<br /><br />Take smoking, for example. People smoke cigarettes for a reason. Non-smokers, who have gone their entire lives without ever once trying a cigarette, believe that the reason people start smoking has something to do with stupidity. This is, I think, an oversimplification, and it's at best incomplete. Cigarette smoking fulfills certain mental, physical, psychological, emotional, and most importantly, <em>social</em> needs, of the individual. To look upon this behavior with a rational mindset, and to dismiss those who choose to smoke as simply lacking in intelligence, is completely missing the complexity of the underlying motivation that makes people start smoking...something that even psychologists have a difficult time fully understanding. Refusing to consider the reasons for this kind of behavior is, at best, a wasted opportunity to figure out what really makes people tick.<br /><br />Smokers, just by virtue of stepping outside of parties and lighting up with one another, immediately belong to a little club of their own. If you step outside of your office where you work and you run into someone else whose smoking, there's an instant common ground between the two of you, a subtle bond that forms almost instantly. I know of no other shared behavior that has even close to the same effect in social situations. <br /><br />The smoking ban in most states in restaurants and bars doesn't deter this kind of thing from happening; as a matter of fact, it makes it more likely to happen. (That's not to say the bans are bad things.) People have to step outside to light up, and they meet others doing the same thing. The bonding that occurs is even stronger off the beaten path.<br /><br />William James wrote an essay called "The Moral Equivalent of War", which I had to read in college for reasons I don't remember. His argument was simple: the act of nations going to war with one another and fighting fulfills a certain inborn human need. To get rid of war, you need to replace fighting with something people can do that fulfills that same need. <br /><br />I remember reading this essay, and it dawned on me that if you want to reduce the amount of smoking that happens, what we need is <em>the moral equivalent of smoking</em>. Like I said, I have yet to find any kind of alternative behavior that's just as readily available to anyone, that brings people together, in a way that encourages them to interact with one another, as much as smoking cigarettes does.<br /><br />I'm certainly not telling you that you should stop smoking...it's really none of my business what you do. (Sure, it's not good for your health to be inhaling all of that junk into your body, but don't let anyone try and convince you that you if don't smoke, then you <em>won't</em> die.) But the filling of needs is a very real issue. When you quit something, when you resolve to stop some bad behavior, you need to replace it with something that is a functional and psychological equivalent. <br /><br />You can resolve to go to the gym instead of going to the bar after work; but people don't really <em>talk</em> to each other at gyms very much, and they do at bars. That means, in the absence of any drastic needs for lifestyle change (like a heart attack), this is going to be a tough goal to stick to, even if it is a worthwhile one.<br /><br />Don't just stop bad habits and sit around waiting for things to improve. Stop, and then <em>start doing something else</em>.

        I took my car into a mechanic recently and, no surprise, turns out there's a lot that's wrong with it, and a lot of things that need fixing. Nothing urgent, they tell me, but if anything ever goes wrong, the insinuation is that I'll only have myself to blame...<br /><br />The problem with these kinds of situations is that the person who's giving us advice is also the person that has something to sell us. So when you're dealing with strangers, it's natural to recognize that they have an incentive to be dishonest and approach the situation with caution. It could be one person throwing up mirrors and blowing the smoke at the same time.<br /><br />I try to do my part by being honest. People often find out I do web development and say, "Hey, I need a website!" or "I have one, but it looks terrible! Can you help me?" Generally, I ask them: "Do you want the site to look great? Is design a big part of it?" Usually they respond in the affirmative, at which point I inform them that I'm actually a pretty lousy designer, but that I'm good at the nerdy database stuff, and this is seldom what they need.<br /><br />But what about those times I meet someone who actually needs someone like me to help them out with their website? How do they know they can trust me? Simple answer: they can't.<br /><br />There is a pain point here, and it's also an opportunity. An objective third-party can't be brought into every situation to give their advice, but in larger ones, it happens all the time. When you buy a home, you hire an inspector to check for dry rot, black mold, or whatever else sends up red flags to home inspectors. It's a small price to pay to avoid an expensive problem later on.<br /><br />My guess is that there's a lot of out-of-work mechanics, particularly in Detroit, right now. Here's the thing: when I'm shopping around for cars on Craigslist, and I go to meet the seller and look at the car, I don't know how to evaluate a car. I'd gladly pay someone $50 bucks for 30 minutes to an hour of their time to come with me and tell me if I'm about to buy a lemon. Mechanics probably do these kinds of evaluations for close friends for free; I think it's a business waiting to happen. Set up a website, then advertise yourself to local people on Carfax.<br /><br />But how do you know if you need a lawyer? You have to talk to a lawyer. Bummer how that works.
