                      Last week I was having lunch with a friend of mine at a Mexican restaurant, and in the interest of not passing out into a food coma during the afternoon after we returned to work, we both had salads. As my friend got to the bottom of his, he pointed out something about his salad."These chunks of [some component of the salad] should be diced up into larger squares and not these flat little strips....

                      Microsoft takes a lot of crap from just about everyone. If you're a writer who uses Word for most of your projects, you probably have a problem with all of those auto-whatever features that interfere with your work by making annoying attempts to format what you're writing as a list, or finishing writing words for you after you've only typed the first few letters of one.

                      Bad design can ruin our entire day with one fell swoop. Last Friday, I went to Merrill Lynch to talk retirement funds and bonds and whatever else. When I got to the entrance, there were two huge wooden doors with large wrought-iron handles just begging for me to pull on them. I pulled.Nothing. The doors didn't budge.Okaayyyy. Push. Still nothing. Hmmm...do I have the wrong day? Are they closed? Nope, I can see through the...

                      So, I've just made the long drive across a stretch of desert from Tucson back to where I live in Santa Barbara. That's not a real long day, but it's enough that my brain feels like a fried egg and I'm having some difficulty trying to re-adjust to the computer keyboard from which I've been away for about a week...it's quite a bit louder than I remember it being a week ago.

                      A funny thing happened to me on Facebook recently. After struggling for about 37 minutes to come up with a status message of pure hilarity, I finally opted to put in a bunch of characters that you get when you hold down shift and furiously hit the numbers at the top of your keyboard. It made it look like I was saying something full of expletives, but they were left to the imagination of the...

                      Everyone that I know is pretty creative. When I think about all the late night conversations I've had with most people, even complete strangers that I only ever talked to once, I'm always fairly impressed with the ideas that people come up with. It might some gadget that they wanted in their kitchen or bathroom, or maybe it's some idea for a television show they'd like to see put into production. More often than not,...
