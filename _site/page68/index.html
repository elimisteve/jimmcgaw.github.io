      <div class="content">
        Last week I was having lunch with a friend of mine at a Mexican restaurant, and in the interest of not passing out into a food coma during the afternoon after we returned to work, we both had salads. As my friend got to the bottom of his, he pointed out something about his salad.<br/><br/>"These chunks of [some component of the salad] should be diced up into larger squares and not these flat little strips. I can't grab them with the fork."<br/><br/>This comment made me laugh. My friend is a trained chef, so he knows a thing or two about food preparation, and when he criticizes people for their efforts in preparing food, I know that he actually has a point worth heeding, and he isn't just blowing off steam because he's really angry about something else, like high gas prices or the economy or whatever frustrates people these days.<br/><br/>I had never thought about it before: <em>usability in food</em>. I've actually thought about how much I hate to order a salad in a restaurant because there's really no easy way of eating them. Sure, we have a fork, and then we kind of <em>stab</em> at the goddamned thing in an effort to get a good variety of salad fixins onto the fork with each bite. Depending on the salad, this can be a really difficult thing to do. Sometimes, like with my friend's salad, there are pieces that you just can't stab at deeply enough to get up. Or maybe you can, but you can't do it without scraping the plate underneath and making that really face-wrenching horrible squeal of metal on plate. So, instead, you try and get underneath those pieces with a scooping motion, using some kind of reverse magician-pulls-the-tablecloth-out-from-under-the-dishes kind of sleight of hand to get all the stuff on top of the fork. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn't, and it's just plain maddening. This is why I'm such a big fan of burritos. Simple, encapsulated food.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, I ranted and raved on here about a door knob that really irked me and ruined my afternoon. A couple weeks later, the fires in Santa Barbara forced me to evacuate the little nest of renter's insurance-covered junk that comprises my apartment, and I went to spend a few nights with my friend, the aforementioned chef dude. On his bookshelf, I found a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465067107/ref=nosim/liqurule-20">The Design of Everyday Things</a>. In the very first chapter, the author talks about the frustrations of poor doorknob design.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I bought this book the very next day. As it turns out, it's kind of a classic, and has become required reading in a lot of engineering schools. I can see why. Often times, the people responsible for creating things we use every day get caught up in trying to add lots of gizmos and features and things, but just end up needlessly complicating matters. Good design is not easy. Good, self-explanatory design for functional objects is much, much harder.<br/><br/>Anyway, go buy the book. It's good. And it reminds you that we're not little piles of flesh that don't impact one another. Everything we create has purpose, and often part of that purpose is to be used by others. Screw the status quo. You can always do better and help others. And don't tolerate bad work from others.<br/><br/>In case you don't really want to read the book, you can view the following parody video. It's a hyperbole, and a perfect (and funny) example of engineering power run amok without any considerations for usability or testing. It also has a thing or two to say about the junk they put on the side of product packaging:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/sony_releases_new_stupid_piece_of">Sony Releases New Stupid Piece of Sh*t That Doesn't F*cking Work</a><br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

        Microsoft takes a lot of crap from just about everyone. If you're a writer who uses Word for most of your projects, you probably have a problem with all of those auto-whatever features that interfere with your work by making annoying attempts to format what you're writing as a list, or finishing writing words for you after you've only typed the first few letters of one. If you're an avid fan of pornography who surfs the Internet constantly with Adminstrator privileges, you've probably got your two cents to contribute about how <em>slow</em> your copy of Windows XP is running. If you're a command-line Unix freak you probably hate the GUI. If you're a business ethics professor, then no one is really paying any attention to what you're saying in those long-winded lectures, they're just learning and memorizing enough to pass your stupid little exams.<br/><br/>As a software developer, I'm inclined to cut Microsoft some slack because, while the software they produce is far from perfect, it's pretty damned good, does what it's supposed to do about 90% of the time with a minimum of fuss. And by "fuss" I mean "wildly erratic and unexpected behavior that completely ruins my day". No, it isn't perfect because it's often only as good as the person who is using it. You need <em>some</em> background to understand how to do what you want with the OS and with the Microsoft Office Suite. Not a lot, but if you've never used a computer before it takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>Creating software that works as well as something like Microsoft Excel is a difficult thing to do. I spent four years working as accountant, which basically means that the landscape of my computer screen was Excel spreadsheets. After spending this much time trying to do the kind of crap that accountants do, day in and day out, I have to say that most of what I set out to accomplish in Excel was pretty easy. It was intuitive, usable, and made my life several times easier than it would have been had I just been working in the era of those old ledgers. (with the possible exception of PivotTables) Cool. I give them mad stupid phat props.<br/><br/>But one requirement I have for software is that it's consistent. I remember the first time that I opened up a copy of Excel 2007. The only reason I did it was because I finally got to a point with a project where I needed more rows. In case you were too busy having some kind of life to notice it, Excel 2003 has a limit on the number of rows you can have in a single spreadsheet, and it's 65536. That's not an arbitrary number; it's actually 2<sup>16</sup>, which was clearly a decision made by a programmer. Excel gives us 16-bits worth of rows! Hurray!<br/><br/>Excel 2007 offers over a million rows, which, in some unlikely circumstances, might be needed by some people in business somewhere. It happened to me. And that's why I downloaded 2007 and opened it up.<br/><br/>I was immediately lost. I'm a seasoned Excel user, and I can make the 2003 version sing and dance and bend to my will like some kind of spreadsheet slave-bot, but when I got into Excel 2007, it was as though someone had dumped me into an alley in some backwater street in Boston and instructed me to find my way to Fenway Park. (on a day when all the taxi drivers don't speak any <em>ingles</em>, let's pretend)<br/><br/>Now, I won't bore you with the details of my miraculous escape. Suffice it to say, I eventually figured out how to do a simple sort, create an auto-filter, and got things working properly the way I needed. But really, why did it have to be that difficult. I remember the switch from Excel 2000 to 2003, and it was a very tiny curb. It was a dime on the railroad tracks. It didn't do anything to confuse me because the two programs were basically designed the same. Excel 2007 takes redesign to a whole new and useless level. The real problem here is that none of the changes are any kind of improvement. They really just moved all the crap around so that it's all arranged differently, so now we've got tabs instead of menus, and icons instead of menu items. Once I got used to that, I was <em>no more productive</em> in my daily tasks using 2007 than I was 2003. This leads me to my conclusion about the main point in redesigning a piece of software that wasn't broken: there wasn't one. It was a pointless endeavour taken on by programmers who wanted to spend their days overhauling the UI instead of whatever else is under the Microsoft Excel hood.<br/><br/>Vista seems to be the same way. There are lots and lots of changes, but you can easily make a case that none of it is any better than XP. I remember writing a while back that each time Microsoft releases a new OS, people's hatred of it is based mostly on their own resistance to change from the last one, and a lack of technical prowess. I still think that's true, but now that I've taken a year to reflect on that point, I realize that the user's own bumbling attitude about the technology isn't the user's problem: it's Microsoft's. Ultimately, Vista <em>is</em> a failure simply because people don't like it. People keep using XP. Technical people can foam at the mouth as long as they want to about how stupid people are for not adapting to Vista, but really, expecting anyone to sit down with The Windows Vista Missing Manual and wading through all of the crap that has changed is not realistic. It's dumb. Software should serve the customer, and not the other way around. And really, the only benchmark we can use for software is market response. That's why Vista blows, and it's not just my opinion: because people continue to use XP.<br/><br/>But, I'm going to stand by Microsoft because, as I mentioned, they try really hard and for the most part, they succeed. And, like most people do when they run out of actual arguments, I'm going to play this card: <em>you couldn't do any better.</em> That's right. I went there. Software is tough, and you, with your opinions, couldn't make a better operating system than Vista. And I'm going to prove my point using something that each of us probably encounter daily: Facebook Apps.<br/><br/>Facebook Apps lower the barrier to entry. A single person can create a Facebook App that people are supposed to use, and all you need is your own server and some basic knowledge of how to make web service calls. It's not terribly difficult to do, from a purely technical standpoint. The real issue comes up in quality control.<br/><br/>First off, I'm thankful that I no longer constantly get invited to participate in Facebook Apps. A lot of them have this way of tricking you into clicking a button that invites every one of your friends to do what you just did, and I hate this. It's the viral marketing gurus sitting around talking about they can create the Next Big Thing, as if this could happen by tricking people into clicking a button. That's right, start your marketing effort by pissing people off while they're trying to take your useless "What is your Poo telling You?" quiz or whatever. Doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I took one of these little quizzes recently, in an App titled "Where Should You Live?" The premise was, based on my personality and my taste in my living conditions, what city should I be living in? I found this on the profile page of an old college friend of mine, and his result had been published to his wall: "Dublin, Ireland". That suited him, because he was an avid Guinness drinker and was fond of the outdoors, so I decided to see what it would come up with for me.<br/><br/>First of all, the questions were too transparent. They asked about weather preferences, if I liked living near or in the mountains, by the ocean, etc. As if I couldn't take that list of information myself and just find a spot on a globe that matched my criteria. It wasn't adding any value or doing anything that I couldn't just as easily do myself. Second, the thing was rife with spelling errors. Simple ones. Ones that would have been caught if the guy who created it had only asked his mom to proofread the damn thing. But, I'm not really much of a spellcheck Nazi. If someone writes with the occasional typo and I get the point, then I won't whine about it because I have better things to do with my life. <br/><br/>But the results were just plain wrong. One of the questions asked about the weather I prefer, and I chose the answer: "I hate winter. Give me hot and suny [sic] all the time! I like lots of sun!" And when I clicked past that annoying "Invite all your friends to suffer this quiz" step and actually had it generate the result, it came up with the following:<br/><br/>"You should live in: <strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>. You like the long, cold winters but also enjoy..."<br/><br/>After the first few words I stopped reading because it was laughably inaccurate. Even if you get past the fact that the questions were hollow and plagued with grammatical errors, and the fact that it just happened to pick the exact same city that it picked for my friend (at this point I'm not sure it's even possible to get any result other than "Dublin, Ireland"), it was completely wrong, as if it had entirely ignored that question about my weather preferences.  As much as the atrocious Excel 2007 redesign irks me, at least no version of Excel ever did anything like <em>that</em>. This is what you get when you're one person trying to create a simple program that is supposed to crawl down a simple decision tree to get to a final result and you get lost in the process. If you can't handle that, how do you think you can improve Vista?<br/><br/>Creating software gets easier all the time. Making software that doesn't suck isn't easy. Microsoft generally manages to make things that have a minimum suck factor, especially when you consider that they were created by gobs of people from different walks of life with different opinions about everything who were all supposed to work together to create one huge working program. I think it's pretty impressive, even though it isn't perfect, and we really shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking we could do any better ourselves. We can <em>hate</em> that stuff as consumers, but we, as software creators, shouldn't start assuming we can do a whole lot better.<br/><br/>To put it another way: I hate John Meyer. I can't play guitar and maybe I don't understand the domain of unlistenable pop rock garbage. Doesn't mean I, as a musician, could write a song more musically accomplished than him. After all, if I wrote a pop rock song, no one would buy it. The market speaks.

        Bad design can ruin our entire day with one fell swoop. Last Friday, I went to Merrill Lynch to talk retirement funds and bonds and whatever else. When I got to the entrance, there were two huge wooden doors with large wrought-iron handles just <em>begging</em> for me to pull on them. I pulled.<br/><br/>Nothing. The doors didn't budge.<br/><br/>Okaayyyy. <em>Push</em>. Still nothing. Hmmm...do I have the wrong day? Are they closed? Nope, I can see through the windows next to the doors and inside, there's clearly the general bustle of workday activity going on in Merrill Lynch's own version of cubicle hell. Let's try again. Push then pull, quickly, and still nothing.<br/><br/>I started to think back to the opening scene of <em>Hellraiser</em>, where the guy is trying to crack that little cube puzzle, moments before the Cenobytes show up and rip him apart. What is the answer to this conundrum? As I started getting very annoyed, I looked down and saw, below those gigantic wrought-iron handles, a small doorknob on one side. I reached down, twisted, and voila! I headed inside.<br/><br/>In the case, the problem ended up being the ass-hat that decided the huge wooden antique doors, with their fancy wrought-iron handles, just <em>had</em> to stay, but they decided to put in a new doorknob, for some reason...I guess in order to stay current with the latest in doorknob technology that's been created by the advanced doorknobologists with their PhD's.<br/><br/>Whoever made the decision about those doors made a design decision: leave the old ones up, handles and all, but add the new doorknob. A fine idea that preserves the overall look and feel of the building from a great distance, but is terrible once any new person tries to enter the damned building. There was a time, not so long ago, when I would have been faced with this situation and embarrassed about not being able to figure out the door on the Merrill Lynch building. I would have slipped into the building with my head down, hoping no one saw me standing stupidly at the door trying to figure out how to open it, secretly worried that everyone was laughing at me for being so dumb.<br/><br/>Not anymore.<br/><br/>The decision to make the doors like that was a <em>bad</em> one. It was a horribly wrong one, and the person who did it should not be allowed near any place producing any product that's meant to be used by human beings, unless he's taken out back and beaten with reeds in a muddy ditch until he realizes his mistake. Better yet, let's stick him behind the wheel of a car on the highway, and the car has two different brake pedals: one that's huge and decorative but does nothing, and one much smaller but functional one tucked away below it someplace. Let's see just how much he likes being confused.<br/><br/>I've got nothing against ornate design. But don't let it interfere with anything functional that's tied to any task I'm trying to accomplish, and that goes triple for anything simple, like opening a door.<br/><br/>There's probably still a few people snickering at me. "Oh, Jim couldn't figure out how to <em>open a door</em>." And now I'm griping about it like some old man in a restaurant who's annoyed that the bread on his sandwich was a little stale so it hurt his dentures when he bit into it. Okay, fair enough.<br/><br/>But I really do think our lives are just swamped with little annoyances like the doors. Some engineer somewhere decides to create something a certain way, and even if it defies common sense, he says, "Screw people if they can't figure it out. What I created is <em>fine</em>." No, it isn't. People like you are making our lives borderline miserable in subtle, sometimes undetectable ways. You're creating small inefficiencies in a much larger system that are causing it to have more entropy than it should, and it's breaking down a lot quicker than it ought to. Thought you might like to know you're a detractor to mankind.<br/><br/>I've had only a couple of web development jobs in my day, but I remember when I lived back in the Detroit area, I had several technical interviews for software jobs. Sometimes people asked me theoretical questions about the nature of object-oriented programming, sometimes they asked me to write code, and two of them even asked me how I felt about managing a team (yikes, turn around and run in the other direction. Couldn't they tell I was only 24?)<br/><br/>There's one thing that I've never been asked to do in a job interview for a programming position, and that's <em>read</em> a big bunch of existing code. This is strange, because as developers working on a core product or websites, it's key that we're able to quickly take a massive load of someone else's garbage and decode it, to figure out what in the hell it's doing. Sure, I'll write a brand-spankin' new function for an HR person that does some simple addition, or whatever, but when you get right down to it, a lot of what we do is just reading someone else's work figure what functions have already been created so that we don't have to redo them ourselves.<br/><br/>This can get tricky very quickly, particularly if your programming language <em>du jour</em> is something other than Python. For the last two weeks at my new job, I've been thanking my lucky stars that I'm staring at Python code instead of something like Perl or C++. Python actually forces beautiful code, because it won't run properly unless you've got the indentations set correctly. This might sound like a trivial feature of the language, but the guy who created it realized that as developers, a huge portion of our time is spent reading existing code instead of pounding out new stuff, and wouldn't it be phenomenally easier if the interpreter for a language forced you to write code that was formatted in a way that was easily readable by other human beings? Yes. It's a brilliant addition to the language. If I'm speaking to anyone with the itch to create a new programming language, take note that this was the best idea that anyone's come up with, and implemented, in the past 20 years in the wide world of programming, as far as I'm concerned. Automatic memory management via garbage collection is a close second.<br/><br/>While no one outside of my friend Mark is probably still reading this post, this is the perfect example of someone who was dissatisfied with the status quo and decided to take it upon themselves to design something better. <br/><br/>I think that, no matter what position we are in, we have opportunities to change things for ourselves, and for others, all the time, just by making small changes to the way we do things. Even if you're working in fast food handing out bags of fries and burgers in a drive-thru, pack the bags so that when a person reaches in without looking and pulls something out, the container of fries doesn't invert and dump all the fries out into the inside of the bag. Or you could arrange the contents of the bag so that you ensure the fries <em>do</em> spill everywhere. Either way. People who are eating fast food and driving at the same time probably deserve that, a little. Just be very aware of the fact that you <em>can</em> effect a change, good or bad, on your surroundings and the people you interact with on a regular basis.<br/><br/>You may say that I sound like an old man because I'm whining about the way things are, but at least I'm not complacent and passively accepting of things that are clearly broken. I'm not set in my ways just yet, I'm making a conscious effort to be oblivious to things, and this is something we should all be doing, for all our sakes.

      <div class="content">
        So, I've just made the long drive across a stretch of desert from Tucson back to where I live in Santa Barbara. That's not a real long day, but it's enough that my brain feels like a fried egg and I'm having some difficulty trying to re-adjust to the computer keyboard from which I've been away for about a week...it's quite a bit <em>louder</em> than I remember it being a week ago. In any case, I'm trying to re-orient myself, and so, without further ado, let me tell you why, at this particular point in my life, I'm planning not to have any kids.<br/><br/>I just spent the last week with family, my grandma, my uncle and aunt, my parents...and my two little cousins, Paul and Kate, who are ten and six, respectively. Now, I had a great time, and I was very happy to see all of them, but I noticed something: I spent the bulk of this past week completely exhausted, almost as soon as my morning coffee was finished and the kids showed up to hang out for the day. I found that hanging out with kids, or at least in the company of kids, is very draining, and I'm having a hard time figuring out why that might be. It wasn't a matter of physical tiredness, per se, but more a mental one. As soon as the kids had gone home for the night, I would crack open a book and then proceed to just stare through the pages. I couldn't bring myself to focus mentally on any given thought that required any more of an attention span than a book full of Gary Larson cartoons.<br/><br/>My best guess: my brains gets bored very easily, and when I don't use it all day, it becomes as barren and dry as the desert that I just spent the last nine hours driving through, and begins to shut itself down. I guess it thinks that it's in hibernate or power-conserve mode or something, and when I don't spend any amount of time loading bytes into it, it just simmers and ends up pulsating quietly within the confines of my skull like a big blob of jello.<br/><br/>And kids, any kind of kids, not just my two little cousins, are not that stimulating as far as I'm concerned. Oh sure, I'm sure that people who are parents, and who have spent loads of time combing through the vast body of literature that's out there on child-rearing and how to raise kids, think it's a great challenge. I imagine it's very stimulating to raise a child, and that it's a very interesting to make some kind of conscious effort to influence their line of thinking in some way. That's great. I'm not doing that. I realize you only get out of things what you're willing to invest, but I see no reason for me to start experimenting with how to interact with kids in the interest of learning anything that is useful to me. <br/><br/>I enjoy learning. I like the free-flowing exchange of ideas, and of getting a sense of other people's perspectives on things. I think it's invaluable to put yourself into someone else's shoes and get a sense of their personal context, and understand why they think the way they do. I try and do this with everyone I meet, whether or not I'm ever going to see them again. I do this because I've started noticing patterns in people, and have used those occasionally to strike up more interesting conversations with people. I'm also quite selfish, and am always on the lookout for new information that I might benefit from learning. It's odd to hear two people arguing about something that's largely a matter of opinion, like what programming language is better. ("Coldfusion is better!" "No, PHP is better!") It's like listening to penguins yell at each other.<br/><br/>Whenever I hear anyone who is...well, wait. I was going to say "older", or "more experienced", but that's not quite right. Experience and age don't necessarily mean anything as far as criteria for who I'm going to listen to. I listen to just about everyone, and at least consider what they have to say. I try and take everything in and let my brain retain the information that it perceives as important, instead of trying to make the judgement call all by myself.<br/><br/>Kids are much different. Instead of being able to verbally poke them and let them babble on about whatever, so that I can listen and get a sense of who they are, I have to take a much different approach. Like I said, as far as kids go, I'm very lazy, so I take the "echo" approach in dealing with kids. Here's an exchange typical of the past week:<br/><br/>Kate: Jimmy, Snow bear has fwowers in his basket.<br/>Me: "<em>Fwowers</em> in his basket?"<br/><br/>As you can see, the echo approach tends to be repeating the last phrase in the sentence, emphasizing one word that wasn't emphasized in the original sentence, and turning the phrase into a question. It's passive, and it sucks, but it lets that poor little girl know that I was listening to her, seriously, I am...I'm  just missing one of three things:<br/><br/>1. I might not have understood what she said. I'm asking her to elaborate so I can figure out what the hell she said.<br/>2. I might not have understood the significance of what she said. Why is she telling me this? Ummm.....[scanning brain, coming up empty]....don't know. Clarify.<br/>3. I might not have any idea how to respond to her. I'm not good with talking with kids because, like I said, I suck at comprehending where they are coming from.<br/><br/>The echo method is pretty callous and impersonal, and to the extent that my little cousins don't much like me, I'm sure it's because they can see through my facade, at least partially, and resent me for acting like a cyborg. It's tough to know at what age you're supposed to treat children like they're adults and when you're supposed to simply try and teach them to play patty-cake or whatever it is kids do these days. <br/><br/>I had particular difficulty because my uncle's kids are so damned bright for their ages, especially Paul, who, for a ten year old, is very intelligent. He said his favorite subject was chemistry, which made sense because he spent three days wearing a T-shirt with a periodic table of the elements on it. I asked him, out of genuine curiosity, because I couldn't remember for the life of me, to explain what a covalent bond was. He pulled out a crayon (do chemists use crayons these days?) and drew a picture of the compound methane, which is apparently CH<sub>4</sub>, and explained that the carbon atom shares an electron with each of the hydrogen atoms, and that's why it's a covalent bond or something. I really have to admit I wasn't listening to him so much as I was astonished that this ten-year-old was explaining something that I didn't learn until much later. I wasn't ten when I learned Chem 101...I was in tenth grade.<br/><br/>Good for him. I hope that he goes on to engineer a better-smelling toilet urinal mint that doesn't spray back at you when you piss on it, and that he makes a million dollars off of it.<br/><br/>As it happens, I start a new job tomorrow, at <a href="http://www.greensherpa.com/">Green Sherpa</a>, an online personal cash flow management website designed for individuals which is supposed to act like Quicken, but on the Internet, in hip Internet form. I'm very excited to start, as I'll be working with Python on Django, a language / web framework I really love, in a Unix environment, under a few people that I have a very good impression of, based on my phone screening and interview. At a new job, I always shut down and go into "sponge-mode" in the first week.<br/><br/>Starting a new job is always like pulling off a band-aid. You want to jump in and do it, but you know there's going to be an initial sting. You have to get to know everyone, meeting a bunch of new people, and at some point, you just know that you're going to say something <em>stupid</em>, and everyone will stop talking and <em>stare</em> at you in disbelief, wondering if they heard what they just thought they heard. I'm anxious to get past that initial awkward phase and into the heavy awk phase. (how's that for Unix geek humor? Bad? Yeah...bad.)

        "Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right." -Henry Ford<br/><br/>Like most aphorisms, Henry Ford's quotation is revealing and makes sense at a cursory glance, but when left completely on its own and analyzed thoroughly, it is incomplete. It doesn't really matter how driven I am to make everyone in the world interested in reading the crap I'm writing in this blog...not everyone in the world will take an interest in my own personal thoughts that I'm spewing for my own personal reasons. I'm okay with that. If one or two people read these posts, that's okay. Given reasonably small and attainable goals, perhaps chained together sequentially, I can take Henry Ford's advice to heart a little easier.<br/><br/>But what Ford was really alluding to in the quote above is the power of positive thinking. This alone has probably been the focal point of the overwhelming majority of self-help books you'll find crammed onto the shelves at your local Borders: think positive and you'll be successful. Tony Robbins doesn't need to work at a desk job just because people need this reassurance to give them hope. Figure out how to package that idea and sell it to the masses, and you won't need to, either.<br/><br/>The one package in this self-help area that has caught on like wildfire over the past few years is called <em>The Secret</em>. This wonderful and insightful gem is ready to instruct you on all of the things that you're doing completely wrong in your life and is prepared to help you <em>think</em> your way into success. Frank N' Furter's advice in the <em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> was "Don't Dream It, Be It". The Secret has taken this idea and refactored it into "If You Dream It, You'll End Up Being It...Somehow". This piece of slime even managed to find its way into the Oprah book club, into the homes of millions, thereby putting its author into a home undoubtedly <em>worth</em> millions.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the idea. Really. If this simple concept, applied to people's lives, helps them in some way, and doesn't do any damage, then cool. We all need something to get us out of bed in the morning. The only thing I dislike about The Secret is that its base principle has been dubbed the "law of attraction". Semantically, this places it right alongside the "law of gravity". It's purporting itself as science, which it isn't. There's nothing scientific or peer-reviewed or anything-that's-been-tested-by-boring-guys-in-white-coats-in-labs-that-play-with-test-tubes-all-day about it. This is actually a pretty important distinction to make.<br/><br/>But what about positive thinking? Surely there must be something to it since people shell outs wads of cash to learn more about how to effectively think positively. As it turns out, there is quite a lot to it. Ford may have just been trying to sound deep and attribute his own success to the power of his mind (instead of luck), but intuitively, he was touching upon a very real concept. How we approach a problem, and how we regard ourselves while we're tackling the issue, plays a very key role in the eventual outcome.<br/><br/>One of my co-workers was once getting down on himself because he was having trouble writing some code, and as he sat there disparaging himself, someone else piped up and said, "Hey, careful what you're sitting there thinking about. You're writing all of that negativity to your mental hard drive, and that stuff sticks around." That maybe kind of a dorky thing to say, but it happens to be very true.<br/><br/>There are a lot of psychiatric disorders on the books...like, a lot. Just try dropping a copy of the DSM-IV on your foot sometime and you'll know that the complexity of the human mind, combined with the myriad errors that can occur in complex systems, is a force to be reckoned with. And if you ask a pharmeceutical rep about it, they'll also tell you it's one hell of a cash cow. The latter is probably the reason that a lot of people are quite cynical about the whole profession, and like most stereotypes, there's probably a small amount of truth in it. Some psychiatrists just prescribe pills to try and help people solve their problems without really getting to the heart of the matter.<br/><br/>For most major psychiatric conditions on the books that I've ever heard of, like disassociative personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, or depression, there is a form of treatment known as <em>cognitive -behavioral therapy</em>. The key component of this treatment lies in the first word: it's our cognitions that affect us, and can determine just how mentally healthy we are. Cognitive therapy is designed to identify patterns in our thinking that may be flawed, and are causing or contributing to the patient's mental illness. It can take years to undo the damage caused by these patterns in our thinking and replace them with patterns that we can cope with.<br/><br/>This is pretty easy for me to believe. I was listening to a person talk once about the reasons why conspiracy theories take hold in people's mind so easily. According to him, we all tell stories in our heads. We weave little bits of narrative about our jobs, our lives, the people around us, all in an effort to make sense of the stuff we encounter day in and day out. We're trying to create order out of chaos with these stories in our head, and sometimes, a conspiracy theory makes perfect sense to one person, so they tell another person, who it also makes sense to. The whole thing snowballs and pretty soon we've got a big snowball of whackjobs on the Internet telling everyone that 9/11 was an inside job, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. <br/><br/>Those stories in our head sure are important. And we're the ones who are weaving them. To a large extent, we do have control over our own sense of well-being and happiness. If your boss is treating you like shit at work, and you say, "Well, damn, I must deserve this, because I suck", eventually, your brain's going to just start following that pattern easily. It will become the path of least resistance, and it's the path your mind will start taking all the time, and you will feel bummed out about things, besides just work, because you keep reaffirming to yourself the simple fact that you suck.<br/><br/>The best advice I've ever heard is that when you find your mind going down these roads, stop whatever train of thought you're on (us software guys might call them "mental threads") and turn it around. Tell yourself a happier story in which everything isn't your fault, or things are better than you're making them out to be. It sounds like advice from a high school guidance counselor, and when you say it like that, it sounds pretty silly, but don't worry...if you take this approach, nobody but you needs to know. And I won't tell anyone, especially if you buy my new self-help book, available for a limited time directly to the left of wherever Dr. Phil McGraw's crap is sold.

        A funny thing happened to me on Facebook recently. After struggling for about 37 minutes to come up with a status message of pure hilarity, I finally opted to put in a bunch of characters that you get when you hold down shift and furiously hit the numbers at the top of your keyboard. It made it look like I was saying something full of expletives, but they were left to the imagination of the reader. Now that's comedy gold. <br/><br/>A few people might have read it, but only one person posted a reply: a link to a YouTube video by a band called Sons of Butcher aptly named "Fuck the Shit". The song is about a minute and the lyrics are only these three words. (with a few variations in tense) I have to admit after clicking on this video I laughed a lot harder than I'd like to admit. It's crude, yes, but what I was really laughing at was how uniquely witty this reply to my status message was.<br/><br/>Think about it: his reply was a hyperlink to a video somewhere on the Internet. People can talk in hyperlinks. One person can post a link to a news article, and others can post a response, which might even take the form of another news article or a video that counters the original post. Entire discussions can be had, and people can express themselves without composing a single word. <br/><br/>Now, people referencing other material to express themselves is not new. Books have been around for centuries, and people often point to them, quoting lines from classic works to reinforce their own point or express something succinctly. People carry around signs, wear shirts, and carve graffiti all over everything that reads "John 3:16", a verse that I still have never bothered to look up, and that's really just pointing to something else in order to express...uh, something, without finding the words for yourself. <br/><br/>But the world of a century ago, where the well-educated in society, those who were fortunate enough to be able to read and owned shelves of books, sat around talking about the world's great literature or the importance of implementing eugenics, is a far cry from the world of social bookmarking of today. We can favorite things on del.icio.us, sharing our thoughts and opinions with other people without needing to write a single word. In fact, what in the bloody hell am I doing on here? There must be another article out there making this exact point someplace...I should have found it and just <em>bookmarked</em> it, dammit, and then I could be sleeping instead of beating my tired head against this whole idea.<br/><br/>But this is one thing that has made us more efficient, as far as human beings go. We store references to information instead of the information itself. This is incredibly efficient for memory, which is something of a finite resource. This is something that computers have been taking advantage of for years. In the C language, there is something called a <em>pointer</em>, which is nothing more than variable that points to another variable. It doesn't hold a value, but the location of another variable and its value.<br/><br/>Here's another way to think of it. I'm currently in the last two weeks of my current job. I've put in my notice. This is something that most of the people I work with don't know yet. The management at my company prefers not to tell people when a person resigns, and I haven't figured out why yet. Frankly, I could care less. Chances are, a couple of them might be on here reading this right now, learning for the first time that, yes, I am leaving my job. Sorry. In any case, I've only got a few days left, and I've mostly checked out. My co-workers still ask for my help and try to explain their problems to me and, like the dutiful person who has no vested interest in the issues anymore, my eyes glaze over and my brain drifts off, akin to Homer's brain when Ned Flanders tried to explain how he distinguishes apple juice from cider. Your brain might have done this same thing a paragraph ago when I brought up the C programming language.<br/><br/>But when my boss comes over and asks a question, and bear in mind that <em>they know that I'm leaving</em>, I point right to somebody else, someone working next to me, and insist that they have the answer. Or that they should figure it out. I point elsewhere. I don't have the answer, but I sure know where you can find it! I have no incentive to do the work, and can't benefit from it, but someone else can! I'm such a swell guy!<br/><br/>Much like my stupid example which I worked into this post solely to mention that I'm leaving my job, people <em>think</em> in references because they're lazy. It's simply more efficient to remember where you read something than to remember <em>what</em> you read. And the Internet makes everything we read available to all of us very quickly, much easier than books. This is why people think in URLs, or little searches on their favorite sites. If I asked you to show me a video of something you liked, how many of you would fire up a browser and type something into YouTube? Maybe you have it bookmarked. You know right where to go. Imagine if one day YouTube came offline for any reason...how many broken links would there be sitting in your head? Things you used to know how to find easily, but now you've got to find some other video site, figure out how it works, and hopefully they have the same video you saw before.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this is one of the reasons that the Bible was so successful. Sure, I understand its content has value, and its wide proliferation is also a critical player, I'm not disputing that...but look at the thing. The whole thing is divided into small, manageable chunks that can easily be referenced by a name and two numbers. It's very easy to take one of these chunks, put it on your AIM profile (does anyone actually use those things anymore?), and anyone who reads it can pick up a Bible and easily jump right to the place you took it from and start reading. Maybe someone posted a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald that was interesting. Even if I can figure out that it was in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, it's still way too hard for me to find the quote someplace in the whole godforsaken book.<br/><br/>The bible makes it easy to reference, and this plays on how the human brain operates very well. We don't absorb all of the information we're exposed to; we <em>index</em> it. In the face of all this new technology we're somehow trying to adapt to, our brains are twitchy electrical bundles of pointers and references to information, taking the form of Google searches that will take us to all kinds of garbage residing in the bowels of the Internet. I often wonder if this easy access to information is making us any stupider...maybe a link to the answer just isn't as good as the answer itself. I wouldn't want to be in a doctor's office being diagnosed by some guy in a white coat poking around on WebMD on his iPhone. You might as well set me up with the incompetent boob and the three probe machine from the movie <em>Idiocracy</em>.

        Everyone that I know is pretty creative. When I think about all the late night conversations I've had with most people, even complete strangers that I only ever talked to once, I'm always fairly impressed with the ideas that people come up with. It might some gadget that they wanted in their kitchen or bathroom, or maybe it's some idea for a television show they'd like to see put into production. More often than not, it's a simple idea expressed in a clever way or unique way. Or maybe all of these people have stolen all of these things that I'm impressed by. I dunno.<br/><br/>I really doubt it. When you get right down to it, most people are pretty creative. We all pretty much share the same basic experiences in life, the same struggles, and tend to find escapes from daily routine in the same basic ideas. It's this fundamental lowest common denominator we all share that gives us an intuitive sense of what other people want. Sure, I have an idea for a television show that people might think is funny, and if I could get it produced, and have it executed properly, people might watch it and the damn thing might be profitable. Who knows?<br/><br/>I think the only reason we aren't all trying to express ourselves and be more creative is simply because most people lack focus. This isn't a bad thing...there are times when I need to turn off the little voice in my head and just stop thinking about crazy stuff, like when I'm at work in a meeting. If I really let my mind wander all over the place, who knows what I might suddenly spurt out in front of everyone? It's a survival tactic. It's pragmatism.<br/><br/>But my overall point is that we all have really good ideas. They come to us when we're in the shower, driving to work, or any other time when our brains are basically just drifting through monotony. The thing is that most of us don't bother to <em>retain</em> those ideas in any fashion. We don't write them down, and so they escape us. I was really planning on starting out this post with an example of a really good idea that someone I know had come up with lately...I couldn't think of a single one. Ideas aren't sticky.<br/><br/>So basically, we all have good ideas, but very few of us make the effort to write them down. And of the handful of people who write down the ideas, only a few of them are really good and worth following through on. And of these few, probably only a small handful of these are followed through on, either due to lack of initiative or resources. And of this miniscule portion, probably only a small portion of them are implemented or executed well enough to be successful. No wonder we don't write them down.<br/><br/>But I think in general we don't give ourselves enough credit, and this is unfortunate, because it's a side of ourselves that we fail to nurture. It's part of the reason that I started writing on here. I used to read lots of fiction when I was in high school, and I made a decent effort to write my own stuff. I have a couple of works of "novella" length that I composed during college which will probably never see the light of day again. At some point, I stopped reading fiction because reading stories about stuff that never happened to people who don't exist stopped offering me any entertainment value, and because I stopped reading it, I stopped writing. Fortunately, there are other things for me to read besides fiction, and I live in the age of the Internet, where I can exercise this writing muscle by bloggin about whatever I like.<br/><br/>I've started keeping a notebook handy wherever I go. I once heard the author of "The New Kid on the Block", Jack Prelutsky, say, "The difference between a writer and a non-writer is that a writer writes things down when they come to him." A good summation of just how sloppy our brains our at retaining information. Next time you get that great idea, write it down. It may seem like a thankless chore, but creativity is itself is really only worth so much. Sooner or later you might be looking back over your idea list and see something worth following through on.

        A few months ago, I set up a blog on here, muttering something in brief in a couple of articles about Microsoft's new ASP.NET editor, among other things. I never really had a vision for where that whole plan was supposed to go. I didn't consider my audience, and didn't have a focus on any particular topic. I just wrote.<br/><br/>This second time around, it will be painfully obvious to anyone reading that I haven't learned my lesson. I haven't created this site with the intention of following any theme in the posts, and it's not written with any particular demographic in mind. (marketing was never my strong suit) <br/><br/>It's up and running now because, same as before, I'm an opinionated person with a passion for writing and expressing myself. Sorry. I've tried over the course of the past six months to sit and output computer code like a machine while ignoring my own internal thoughts, and that approach hasn't worked for me. More often than not, keeping my thoughts to myself just builds them up, and sooner or later they come spewing out incoherently at someone I'm talking to, usually regarding some very lame topic. For those who haven't been witness to one of these episodes, it's a lot like Charlie on <em>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>, when he starts ranting about something.<br/><br/>Obviously, my thoughts need an output. I remember being quite an introvert in high school, but for an entirely different reason than why I'm an introvert now. In high school, I was quiet out of <em>fear</em>...fear that someone might recognize just how naive I was about everything. I didn't open my mouth for fear that my ignorance about everything would pour out in droves. <br/><br/>There was a period in college, and shortly after, when I wasn't introverted. I spoke out a lot, about anything I wanted, about whatever was on my mind. I suppose, at it's core, this was also out of fear...I was just afraid of not making an impression on people. I wanted to be remembered, gossiped about, hated, whatever...anything to engage people and learn about how to interact with people. Plus, there was booze, and a little social lubricant always helps the mental juices find their way to the tongue.<br/><br/>I'm more reserved these days, for two reasons: first, I tend to think about some fairly nerdy stuff, like solving computer problems. Second, and more importantly, I always consider my audience before opening my mouth. This might sound like the same kind of fear as high school: <em>what if no one cares what I'm thinking about? I'd bore them by talking about it!</em> You might be partially right. I might be using consideration for others' tolerance of me as a euphemism for my own terror of sounding like a boring geek. Naturally, I'm going to say that doesn't sound quite right...in most social situations, I don't feel afraid one bit.<br/><br/>In case you're reading this, let me reassure you...I won't be talking tech on here very much. I might point it out at times, to use it as an example that encompasses some larger point I'm prattling on about. I'm just on here to write. If any of these topics interest you, cool. If not, that's cool too. Feel free to post a comment about how annoying you think I am. I won't take it personally.<br/><br/>I'm really on here to vent...not out of anger, just out of an impulse to express myself. The world is a big and complicated place, and one thing I've learned is that the more certain I am that I understand a particular subject, the more of a greenhorn I am about that subject. Recently, I stumbled across some poker tip on the Internet and, after reading it, I thought, "That's just common sense, why did I just read that?" <br/><br/>Bullshit. I know a little bit about the theory of poker, but I've never sat down and dominated a table in real play. The fact is, I was inclined to dismiss the advice because I found it so elementary, and this is a bad thing. First off, a poker expert would welcome a revisiting of basic poker principles because they don't take any reinforcement of the basics for granted. They're just as important, if not more so, than the more advanced strategies. <br/><br/>And, more importantly, my initial reaction smacks of the fear I spoke of earlier. Even internally, I was remiss to acknowledge how little I really knew about poker. I think we all do this...we're hesitant to admit, especially to ourselves, just how little we really know. We'd like to think because we've suffered the agonies of high school, crammed our way through college, and spent a few years at some shitty real-world job that we know everything. This is understandable...my ego does protect me in a lot of cases, and it gets me out of bed each morning. It makes sense that it would try and convince me that I know everything about everything.<br/><br/>But real experts know their limits. They know what they don't know, and that's a large component of being an expert. It's a prerequisite to mastering any discipline: having that moment of clarity, when it dawns on you just how much you don't know. With that comes the humility to ask for help when you need it.<br/><br/>Okay, so this "Hello!" entry I decided to write ended up devolving into something that sounds like dialogue from an upcoming <em>Karate Kid</em> movie. My overall point is that I've been touching upon a lot of subjects about which I know very little, and I often find that when I start thinking about different topics, I want to explore them, and that's what I want to do on here. Talk about stuff. I'm eternally grateful that I've outgrown the phase in my life when I felt compelled to write about girls I had crushes on and stuff, a la the middle school years. My hope is that the topics will be <em>slightly</em> more sufferable.<br/><br/>Cheers!
