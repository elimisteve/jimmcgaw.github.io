                      Last January, it finally got to me.I live in the downtown area of a relatively small city; it has a lot of the problems that any normal metropolitan area would, but most of them are far less severe than in larger cities. The one that started catching my attention: litter.This was a gradual process...like a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. I kept seeing people's old Starbucks cups and fast food wrappers on...

                      Boy, do I know that feeling. Inspiration strikes, and you dream up an idea for a book, or product, or some piece of art you can make. (I love it when a plan comes together.) And then, once we have the idea worked through in our heads, what do we do next? As the Fonz said: we sit on it. The reason is simple: we don't want to mess it up. We have no business...

                      Recently, researchers determined it was possible to get into the computer system inside of an automobile and tamper with the functioning of the car's internal computer. And yes, there's potential there for messing with the braking system.As of right now, these kinds of attacks against a car require that attacker to be inside of the automobile. What that means, for now, is that we're perfectly safe driving around in our cars, but you probably shouldn't...

                      Our brains are wired so that if something doesn't fall into a category, then it's invisible. If we can't classify it, then we have a harder time making sense of it, so we ignore it. The last time someone recommended a particular author or band to you, what was the first question out of your mouth?This helps us find what we like, but human beings largely use categories to filter out what they don't want....

                      Starting is pretty easy.I have lots of ideas for projects to do. Over the past few years, I've bought a lot of domain names for sites I didn't end up building, put in time writing pages of books that I'll probably never finish, and bought materials for art projects that I'll never complete. Ideate, start, but it doesn't pan out.Of course, this is my fault, but I'm okay with it. Enough projects get seen through...

                      Jimmy Kimmel has a point.The talk show host declared a week from today, November 17th, as National Unfriend Day. Those of us with Facebook accounts are supposed to "weed out" those people we're connected to on Facebook who aren't really our close friends.Anthropologist Robin Dunbar made a simple observation: we can only have so many meaningful friendships. The number hasn't been precisely nailed down, but's commonly cited as 150. Any more people than that and...

                      "Markets are conversations."So begins the book The Cluetrain Manifesto, one of the classic books about marketing in the age of the Internet. It was written about ten years ago, and since then, I've heard lots of people quote the maxim above in their own writing about marketing. The idea: you can sell people something if you can get them talking about it, or get them talking with you.About ten years later, they released an updated...

                      A programmer named Nigel Leck got a little tired of arguing with global warming denialists. For years, he's been debating climate change with people on the Internet, and more recently, it dawned on him that he was making the same arguments, and referencing the same resources, over and over again.So what did he do? He automated it.He built a bot and gave it its own Twitter account. Every five minutes, the bot sweeps through Tweets,...

                      In my mind (in other words, this is arbitrary), books fall into three different categories:1. Storytelling - all fiction falls under this umbrella, for example.2. Educational - meant to instruct or teach. Textbooks. 3. Ideas - almost all nonfiction is written with this as its currency.In my very limited experience as a reader, the most insightful and interesting books are the ones that manage to achieve a blend of all three of these.
