        Last January, it finally got to me.<br /><br />I live in the downtown area of a relatively small city; it has a lot of the problems that any normal metropolitan area would, but most of them are far less severe than in larger cities. The one that started catching my attention: litter.<br /><br />This was a gradual process...like a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. I kept seeing people's old Starbucks cups and fast food wrappers on the group. There weren't a lot of them, and I realized that it would be pretty easy for one person to make a dent in how much litter is on the streets and sidewalks.<br /><br />And so, I went to a local hardware store, bought a broom and upright dustpan, and started picking up litter. An hour here and there, about once a month.<br /><br />My reason for doing this is selfish: it's good exercise, and I can't stand going to the gym. I've never been much of an environmentalist, but I do live about a mile away from the Pacific, so maybe my actions will keep stuff out of the ocean. (And admittedly, the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> thing has always creeped me out.)<br /><br />For the last few months, I've had a post running on Craigslist telling people what I'm doing, along with an open invitation for anyone to join me if they so pleased. So far, I've had no takers, a fact by which I'm neither surprised nor disappointed...more for me.<br /><br />I discovered yesterday that this wasn't my idea; about three years ago, a guy named Chip McDermott started doing it up in Laguna. Up there, it's a full blown grassroots movement to keep the streets free of litter, and a whole non-profit organization called <a href="http://biz93.inmotionhosting.com/~zerotr5/">ZeroTrash</a> has been started around the efforts of many. It's happening in LA and in San Diego, too.<br /><br />So, I've decided to start calling myself ZeroTrash Santa Barbara, and I started a <a href="http://zerotrashsantabarbara.blogspot.com/">blog</a> (the 20th one I've started this year, I think) and a Facebook page. I didn't get the permission of the official ZeroTrash organization, so we'll see how they react once they find out I'm using their name.<br /><br />I'm hopeful this changes things. Maybe people will have an easier time pitching in to help an organization with a social media presence, instead of just some anonymous guy on Craigslist claiming he's picking up garbage.

        Boy, do I know <em>that</em> feeling. Inspiration strikes, and you dream up an idea for a book, or product, or some piece of art you can make. (I love it when a plan comes together.) And then, once we have the idea worked through in our heads, what do we do next? As the Fonz said: we sit on it. <br /><br />The reason is simple: we don't want to mess it up. We have no business starting to write our perfect book until we've mastered the art of writing. Otherwise, the merits of the idea will be blurred by the imperfect use of a perfect medium.<br /><br />This is the ultimate excuse for procrastinating, and I know because I've used it dozens of times. I know, because in the last ten years, I've sat on top of several "masterpieces". Each of them was a "perfect" idea that had to be executed perfectly or else it'd be ruined.<br /><br />Here's the truth: we really like ideas when they're shiny and new, but after a certain point, they psychologically depreciate in our minds. Gradually, we care about each idea less and less as it ages, and we spawn new ideas to distract ourselves with. Out with the old...<br /><br />What that means is that you have two choices: you can do nothing, and sit on your idea, all the while stressing about the plethora of reasons you can't do it. Or you can act on your idea, create something new, and realize your vision. In either case, your interest in the idea, your passion for making it happen, is almost certainly going to fade over time.<br /><br />But if you act on your idea, at least you'll have something to show for it.

        Recently, researchers determined it was possible to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/25339/">get into the computer system inside of an automobile</a> and tamper with the functioning of the car's internal computer. And yes, there's potential there for messing with the braking system.<br /><br />As of right now, these kinds of attacks against a car require that attacker to be inside of the automobile. What that means, for now, is that we're perfectly safe driving around in our cars, but you probably shouldn't pick up <a href="http://koldfusion.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/hackers.jpg">Johnny Lee Miller</a> if you see him hitchhiking with a laptop in hand. But it's likely that over the next decade components in cars will come to rely more and more on technologies that are wireless. And it's not inconceivable that at some eventuality, the wrong kind of person might be able to crack into a car's computer while it's in motion.<br /><br />As it stands right now, this will probably never be a big issue for most people, simply because the incentives are not there. I've done much more than the average person does in securing their home computer, but I know that's not enough. I know that there are really smart, really nefarious attackers out there who could easily break into my home computer and steal personal information from me. The reason they're not trying is because I'm not that interesting of a target.<br /><br />Security is not so much about erecting an impenetrable steel wall around you, but a balancing act between what security measures you take and how probabilistic outside threats are. You could buy more homeowner's insurance, but past a certain point, it's not worth it.<br /><br />Someday, though, I'm sure our cars will have our credit cards on file so that cities and states can charge us for speeding and parking tickets right away. That gives people a reason to break in. It'll be interesting to see how the auto manufacturers handle these kinds of potential threats...provided, of course, they choose to handle them at all.

        Our brains are wired so that if something doesn't fall into a category, then it's invisible. If we can't classify it, then we have a harder time making sense of it, so we ignore it. The last time someone recommended a particular author or band to you, what was the first question out of your mouth?<br /><br />This helps us find what we like, but human beings largely use categories to filter out what they don't want. For example, the genres of "heavy metal", "new age", and "electronica" are tags that are applied to music that appeal to subcultures, but which are best avoided by most people. We know to walk right past the "Romance" section in the bookstore.<br /><br />We needed to create the genre so the right people will find the contents, while the rest of us can ignore them.<br /><br />Listening to people discuss movies currently playing in the theater reveals how this works. One person suggests that another go see a particular movie, and the reply comes back: "What kind of movie is it?" If the suggester has trouble shoehorning it into a particular genre, the next question is: "What other movies is it like?"<br /><br />These two queries, about category and comparison, are so common that they almost guarantee that moviemakers aren't working hard to innovate very often. Venturing into truly innovative territory is extremely high-risk. If moviegoers are saying of your movie, "Look, it's hard to describe...just go see it, it's good", then 9 times out of 10, as a filmmaker, you're probably in trouble, since so few people are apt to risk paying to see a movie based on a vague description.<br /><br />If you're smart and play it safe, then you'll pick the category before you start and work from there. If you're smart and want to take risks, you'll ignore the categories involved and create what you want despite them. Two kinds of smart (I just categorized them), each with belying different motives and each capable of achieving great things. But you probably should be aware of which one you are before you begin.

        Starting is pretty easy.<br /><br />I have lots of ideas for projects to do. Over the past few years, I've bought a lot of domain names for sites I didn't end up building, put in time writing pages of books that I'll probably never finish, and bought materials for art projects that I'll never complete. Ideate, start, but it doesn't pan out.<br /><br />Of course, this is my fault, but I'm okay with it. Enough projects get seen through to completion to make it worthwhile, and more often than not, I get far enough that I learn several things before the project is done. <br /><br />Upfront, I usually can't guess which things I'll finish and which I'll abandon halfway into the journey. I just start. It's like throwing a bunch of wet noodles against the wall and seeing which ones stick. The key: they're my noodles, and it's my wall.<br /><br />Sometimes, you just have start and see if it sticks. You might think something feels right, but usually you don't know for sure before you start.<br /><br />Some things are too important to be left to the whims of my attention span, but aside from those, I'm still experimenting to see what it is I'm really passionate about. My guess is it's the same for you.

        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc5bbz5SB7M">Jimmy Kimmel</a> has a point.<br /><br />The talk show host declared a week from today, November 17th, as National Unfriend Day. Those of us with Facebook accounts are supposed to "weed out" those people we're connected to on Facebook who aren't really our close friends.<br /><br />Anthropologist Robin Dunbar made a simple observation: we can only have so many meaningful friendships. The number hasn't been precisely nailed down, but's commonly cited as 150. Any more people than that and our brains start struggling to keep track. As smaller companies grow larger, like Microsoft in its early days, once the number of employees surpasses 150, the group splits in two.<br /><br />This maximum number of meaningful relationships is known as Dunbar's Number. It's the upper cognitive bound on our social life; it's wired into our brains, so it's not something we can escape.<br /><br />Dunbar is currently working to see if this conclusion holds true on the Internet; the jury is still technically out, but he's pretty sure that it will. This means that those friends of yours that have 600, 700, or over 1000 friends don't necessarily have more friends than you. Popularity has a cap...at least, as far as meaningful relationships go.<br /><br />Me, I'm not going to unfriend anybody; I like my list of friends just fine. But I won't take it personally if you suddenly vanish from my friend list. Sometimes our brains just can't keep up.

        "Markets are conversations."<br /><br />So begins the book <em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em>, one of the classic books about marketing in the age of the Internet. It was written about ten years ago, and since then, I've heard lots of people quote the maxim above in their own writing about marketing. The idea: you can sell people something if you can get them talking about it, or get them talking with you.<br /><br />About ten years later, they released an updated edition of the book, in which the starting-gun maxim had changed: "Markets are relationships." One of the co-authors goes on to explain this change came from a conversation he had with a stranger on a plane about the original idea that markets are conversations. Conversations, this stranger suggested to him, are a means of building trust, and so people are more willing to buy from a person once they've established the relationship. The conversation is just a means to this end. And so, the idea changed.<br /><br />In the ten year gap between the two editions of the book, lots of people referenced the original <em>Cluetrain Manifesto</em> and insisted that markets were conversations. It was a popular book, containing lots of popular ideas, and so more people parroted the advice it contained in their own writings than questioned the basic content.<br /><br />This is the problem with experts: we are less inclined to question them.<br /><br />I'm definitely an amateur writer, and part of the reason I enjoy speaking from a pulpit of little or no authority is that I know I'm surrounded by people who will gladly tell me when I'm wrong. When we read the ideas written by <em>any</em> amateur, we're more likely to discern, prod, and pick apart the ideas in our own heads than we are to accept them as absolute or conclusive truths.<br /><br />Not that we shouldn't listen to experts...but in some ways I think the writing of the amateur, when we know they're an amateur, can be more valuable because it's more likely to raise questions than answers, and questions are a better means of arriving at our own truths.

        A programmer named Nigel Leck got a little tired of arguing with global warming denialists. For years, he's been debating climate change with people on the Internet, and more recently, it dawned on him that he was making the same arguments, and referencing the same resources, over and over again.<br /><br />So what did he do? He automated it.<br /><br />He built a bot and gave it its own <a href="http://twitter.com/ai_agw">Twitter account</a>. Every five minutes, the bot sweeps through Tweets, looking for keywords and phrases that are characteristic of denialists, and it auto-responds to them with links to articles that are relevant to the original Tweet.<br /><br />Twitter users have been arguing with the bot, not knowing that they're arguing with a machine. (The 140-character limit in the Twittersphere makes everyone's thoughts seem stunted, so it's actually the perfect place for a machine to hide.) Other people have been getting wind of bot, and many have started playing with the account as a means of testing it. Its failures are attributable to the limits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>, or the parsing of meaning from human language by computers. It's a remarkably complicated area of artificial intelligence. One problem, for example: the bot cannot detect sarcasm, and so it responds to Tweets intended to be tongue-in-cheek as serious.<br /><br />As funny as the project is, and impressive for a feat of programming, it still strikes me as having been created with the wrong idea in mind: that we can change peoples' minds by spewing facts at them. If they don't change their minds, then the solution seems to be to spew more facts, or repeat the facts again and again, until the person's will breaks down and they admit they were wrong.<br /><br />I'm just waiting to see what happens when someone creates a bot to argue the other side of things. Then they can just argue with each other endlessly, back and forth, while everyone else watches. An annoying reminder of the myriad arguments I've witnessed at my jobs between people discussing politics.

        In my mind (in other words, this is arbitrary), books fall into three different categories:<br /><br />1. Storytelling - all fiction falls under this umbrella, for example.<br /><br />2. Educational - meant to instruct or teach. Textbooks. <br /><br />3. Ideas - almost all nonfiction is written with this as its currency.<br /><br />In my very limited experience as a reader, the most insightful and interesting books are the ones that manage to achieve a blend of all three of these.
