                      Self-deprecation is good as a joke, in small bursts, and when it's meant to be funny. Generally, the best way to put people at ease when they expect that you're about to be full of yourself is to make a joke at your own expense.But it only really works when it's honest. Too often, people will use a self-deprecating remark in an effort to cloak their ego. They willingly take a stab at themselves, but...

                      In the past, I've harbored plenty of resentment towards television, but I have trouble doing this now. If you look at the trends, there was clearly an explosion in television-watching around the same time that TV sets became widely available. This looks bad; it makes it seem that TV consumption supplanted a lot of other more important and intellectual pursuits. Perhaps it left us worse off.But the rise in television watching coincides, I believe, with...

                      I'm a little rusty on my history, but I'm willing to bet that Newton didn't have to try terribly hard to get people to accept his theory of gravity. He just had to drop something to the ground in front of him. "That's gravity." And they believed him. (And the venture capitalists were so impressed they wrote him a check on the spot.)We understand it, because we can see it, and I think this is...

                      There are some people who hate the Internet just as much as they hated television. Ray Bradbury is among them. He wrote an entire book about how evil television was for society, since he saw it as a consumptive drain on people's time at home. And now he hates the Internet, for much the same reason.Try as I have, I can't bring myself to see things this way. I can't see the Internet as being...

                      I overheard a conversation between the marketing interns at work. One of them was training the other on how to manage the Twitter account we have. Basically, the instructions were to follow other people at random, keep track and see who followed us back, and to eventually stop following people who didn't.I'll concede that I really haven't figured out how to use Twitter yet, but I do know that the worst corners of it are...

                      They did a study a few years back. Here's the gimmick: they created a lab where people could do searches on Yahoo!, and searches on Google, but the results from both were switched. The Google results page was actually display results from Yahoo!, formatted to look like Google results, and vice versa. The question was posed: which gave you better results?The answer was about what you would expect. Now, if you visit the Googleplex and...
