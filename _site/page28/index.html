        Self-deprecation is good as a joke, in small bursts, and when it's meant to be funny. Generally, the best way to put people at ease when they expect that you're about to be full of yourself is to make a joke at your own expense.<br /><br />But it only really works when it's honest. Too often, people will use a self-deprecating remark in an effort to cloak their ego. They willingly take a stab at themselves, but then feel this gives them license to be "right" from that point forward.<br /><br />One reason that I like self-deprecation in small doses is that it has a tendency to increase self-awareness. People are inclined to listen to others who are like them, and with whom they identify. The lead singer of one of my favorite bands often pokes fun not only at himself, but the stereotype that most of his fans embody. <br /><br />This can only be a good thing, since it's hard to get along with other people when you're ignorant of how they perceive you.

        In the past, I've harbored plenty of resentment towards television, but I have trouble doing this now. If you look at the trends, there was clearly an explosion in television-watching around the same time that TV sets became widely available. This looks bad; it makes it seem that TV consumption supplanted a lot of other more important and intellectual pursuits. Perhaps it left us worse off.<br /><br />But the rise in television watching coincides, I believe, with the rise in disposable time. The technology of the 20th century, that brought with it the television set, brought several other pieces of technology as well. Washers and dryers are one example. Doing the laundry for a household each week used to take hours, and it used to be very labor intensive, with washboards and clotheslines. <br /><br />I think that housewives across the country, having to spend less time on the laundry, and with no other model to follow, decided to spend some time watching television. It's what I do at the laundromat when I've forgotten to bring a book or I'm too tired to read: I watch the television. <br /><br />I think it's difficult to say for sure just how many intellectual pursuits were truly lost to television when it first arrived. If you're going to make that argument, I think you'd have to go back to the proliferation of the radio. Didn't people used to consume that for hours on end before TV showed up?

        I'm a little rusty on my history, but I'm willing to bet that Newton didn't have to try terribly hard to get people to accept his theory of gravity. He just had to drop something to the ground in front of him. "That's gravity." And they believed him. (And the venture capitalists were so impressed they wrote him a check on the spot.)<br /><br />We understand it, because we can see it, and I think this is most of what we think of as science. I don't understand the underlying math equations that govern nature, but I understand the patterns I see in the world around me, and generally, 98% of the time, the patterns have become intuitive to me, and things behave as I would expect.<br /><br />Contrast that with a gyroscope. Ever seen one? You can go into almost any toy store in the country and buy one for about ten bucks. Here's one in action, balancing on a string:<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jfv3Puy-NyY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jfv3Puy-NyY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />See that? It isn't quite magic, because I know there's no trickery involved, but at the same time, I don't understand it. Sure, I'm willing to bet there's some complex equations that explain this kind of behavior, but they're waaaayyyy beyond me. What's happening here just doesn't make sense. Even with tourists on Segways zipping all over town (they're balanced by industrial gyroscopes inside of them), this is the kind of science that I just can't take for granted. My intellect isn't capable of it.<br /><br />Looking upon the world with wonder is, I believe, all about not taking things for granted.

        There are some people who hate the Internet just as much as they hated television. Ray Bradbury is among them. He wrote an entire book about how evil television was for society, since he saw it as a consumptive drain on people's time at home. And now he hates the Internet, for much the same reason.<br /><br />Try as I have, I can't bring myself to see things this way. I can't see the Internet as being just a new time-suck factor in people's lives. It enables too much. Whereas television is passive and limited as far as choices go, the Internet affords almost unlimited choice and you very much have to decide what you're going to spend your time consuming.<br /><br />You can learn how to do home repairs. You can learn wilderness survival. You can learn how to be a more effective public speaker. Actually, you could learn all of that on television too...but on the web, it's there when you realize you need to know it.<br /><br />It may be better if people read books than watch TV or browse the web; I'm not in a position to say. But if people, in your opinion, aren't choosing to spend their time on the Internet in productive ways, or in ways that enrich their lives, you can blame it on their education or upbringing.

        I overheard a conversation between the marketing interns at work. One of them was training the other on how to manage the Twitter account we have. Basically, the instructions were to follow other people at random, keep track and see who followed us back, and to eventually stop following people who didn't.<br /><br />I'll concede that I really haven't figured out how to use Twitter yet, but I do know that the worst corners of it are those accounts being used to hawk products, like dietary supplements for bodybuilders or viagra, where everyone is trying to get anyone who will to follow them, and where people follow others based on reciprocity. Sometimes these people have thousands of followers and are following as many people. Nobody's keeping track of all of these things. It's a free-for-all, everyone's yelling, nobody's listening.<br /><br />I try to say things that are interesting or entertaining. I follow others who offer me the same. I don't follow anyone who follows me and don't expect that from people I follow.<br /><br />I'm not sure the whole "link exchange" model that drove online marketing almost a decade ago translates to social media. Me, I'd rather have 10 people following me who genuinely like what I have to say than 10,000 people following me because I promised to enter them into a contest to win an iPad.

        They did a study a few years back. Here's the gimmick: they created a lab where people could do searches on Yahoo!, and searches on Google, but the results from both were switched. The Google results page was actually display results from Yahoo!, formatted to look like Google results, and vice versa. The question was posed: which gave you better results?<br /><br />The answer was about what you would expect. Now, if you visit the Googleplex and ask Larry Page about why he has a better search engine, he's going to tell you it's because he writes code and he's brilliant. Which he is, don't get me wrong...but that answer is incomplete.<br /><br />I've met people who regret not getting more education, e.g. not studying computer science, because they think the opportunity to build something great has slipped by them. I don't agree with this. Education is better than no education, and you can't get away with being a surgeon without learning the ropes, but I don't think a lack of education should stop anyone from trying things.

        A couple of years ago, my girlfriend and I created a quick video as a present to a friend of mine, featuring a small cardboard cutout of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Stanley">Flat Stanley</a> partying with an assortment of other stuffed animals we had lying around our apartment. Since the setting of the whole video was in a club, we set it to 50 Cent's "In Da Club". <br /><br />We put this video up on Facebook. It was up for a while, but within a couple of weeks, it had been removed, and I got a friendly reminder from Facebook not to upload content violating copyright laws.<br /><br />50 Cent, his record label, and Facebook are well within their rights to ask that I remove this content, because it doesn't belong to me. But it did get me thinking: they can't possibly have people patrolling the Internet manually, looking for popular songs. Instead, they probably built a system to analyze audio in videos and see if it matches patterns in copyrighted music. If it does, it's flagged by the computer system for review, and then people check to verify the content is, in fact, an infringement. (They're probably getting us to help pay for this computer system by selling it to us in the form of the Shazam mobile app.)<br /><br />Again, I was in the wrong. I'm not disputing that. But really, think of the man hours and money that were put into building that system? Why not invest that money into a new means of distributing music instead of going after copyright violators? You can't do everything.

        I went into the Apple store and bought something for the first time ever the other day. It was a small purchase, nothing more than a keyboard. In my dealings with Apple as a consumer, I almost always come away with something good to say. (As a developer, it's a slightly different story.)<br /><br />When I told the employee helping me I wanted to check out, he pulled the cash register out of his pocket. It was an iPod touch with some Point-of-Sale functionality hardware attached to it. He scanned the item, swiped my card, and asked for my email to send me the receipt. He sent me on my way.<br /><br />I'm not certain that returning anything is as easy, but Apple is trying to do away with the checkout line, which is arguably the most frustrating part of shopping in stores. Surely most retailers know the technology for a better experience exists...why haven't more of them done this yet?<br /><br />I also wonder when the Salvation Army is going to scrap those red metal buckets and give their bell-ringers such a device for collecting donations.
