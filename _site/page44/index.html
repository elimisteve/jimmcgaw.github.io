        Any assumption that starts out like that is potentially one of the most risky assumptions you can make.<br /><br />Lots of charities aggregate donor and volunteer contact information when they're pitching in or generously cutting them a check. Why? Because it's safe to assume that because they helped you once, or gave to you one time, that they'll want to get an email newsletter or direct mailing from your organization once a month for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />This advice is actually in several books written for people who are running non-profit organizations: compile a list of donors so that later, you can tap them when you need help. How "safe" does that sound to you?<br /><br />Make no mistake: there are probably people who are passionate about feeding homeless dogs vegan diets (if that's what your organization happens to be committed to doing.) But it's a mistake to assume that just because Cynthia Watson cut you a check last Thanksgiving that she wants to hear about the new website your organization just launched...or that she's interested in giving you any more money.<br /><br />My girlfriend gave to a food bank in the Detroit area a few years ago. When we moved to California, they somehow figured out her new address and kept sending her direct mailings at least once a month. How much do you think that was costing them?

        The drunks over at <a href="http://www.drunkard.com/">Modern Drunkard Magazine</a> (yep, that's a real thing) came up with an interesting idea a few years ago. They're based in Denver, so they filled up a chest full of booze, stashed it someplace public in the city, and then created a series of clues which they published in their magazine. If you deciphered the clues (which would make sense only to a Denver resident), it would lead you on a trail that would ultimately land you at the chest, where a bottle of rum and other goodies for drunks was waiting.<br /><br />If you want to engage people and get conversations started in your community about your product or cause (non-profits, I'm looking in your direction), create a treasure hunt in your community and start spreading the clues. If it works, do it once every couple of months.<br /><br />It's difficult to get people's attention these days, but creating a puzzle to solve, coupled with a sense of adventure, seems to work pretty well. Call it the "Lost" formula.

        Traditionally, publishing houses are supposed to act like one giant filter. Lots of authors want to get published, but only a few can. There's a limit to the number of trees we can cut down the shelf space at your local Borders. <br /><br />So Doubleday has to make tough decisions about which books to invest in and which to ignore. At some point literary agents made careers for themselves by acting as the go-between, adding another nightmare layer and barrier to entry.<br /><br />Now, with self-publishing, what value are they offering to readers?<br /><br />This probably won't be of interest to anyone who isn't working in the tech industry, but as a web developer, things change quickly, and I'm expected to stay on top of them, lest I fall out of the loop and become unemployable. Despite this, I make an effort not to spend my working life on the "bleeding edge". I know people who are constantly reading the tea leaves, looking for the next big thing so they can build something with it and show it off to other developers.<br /><br />I'm not an early adopter; I like to wait until things have proven themselves before I commit to learning them. I use this analogy: think of new technology as the sun. If you stare directly at it, you might end up going blind. However, if you watch the seeds that others are planting, you'll see what sources of light are actually enabling things to grow. After so long, you get a sense of which stuff is worthwhile to learn and which was just a flash in the pan.<br /><br />As it turns out, looking at the books the technical publishers are choosing to print is actually a pretty good filter. They do their research, just like they're supposed to, and they don't invest in a book unless they're pretty sure there's a market for that book. It's not perfect, but I've been deferring to their decisions for a few years now, and it's worked pretty well for me.<br /><br />So, the print filter actually is a virtue. Are there any other genres for which this holds true?<br />Publications about medicine and psychiatry, probably. If it's printed in a book, it's mostly a safe bet that it's been peer-reviewed and the contents are written by a real doctor (that asshole Kevin Trudeau notwithstanding.) Major publishing houses that are still relying on printing books to make money have these examples on their side. A medical books implies a sense of authority, and a computer book (at least for me) translates to something worth spending time on. <br /><br />But there aren't a whole lot of other types of books where this holds true. Books in business, fiction, and the social sciences--in other words, books with value predicated on the ideas of the author--don't really need to be printed. In this realm, it's easier, faster, and cheaper to browse and find new ideas online. <br /><br />Books will always have their place in the world, but Doubleday can't count on that to hold true everywhere for much longer.

        In theater parlance, a character in a movie acknowledging the awareness of, or speaking to the audience directly, is known as "breaking the fourth wall". It's not what John Cusack did in <em>High Fidelity</em> or Steve Carell talking to the camera in "The Office", but instead one of the actors breaking character and addressing the audience at some point in the story when it's unexpected.<br /><br />In real life, breaking character is a useful learning tool. One indication that I've done this, and done it well: after the fact, someone says to me, "Jim, that's so unlike you." It also challenges people to rethink their own assumptions.<br /><br />Suggestion: go break your own personal fourth wall at least once this week.<br /><br />P.S. I wrote a couple of months ago about how I <a href="/2010/05/19/passing-along-books.html">buy copies of my favorite books at thrift stores and leave them around town in public places</a>. (Often, people living on the streets will pick them up and read them, if for no other reason than to keep themselves occupied.) Yesterday, I saw a homeless man sitting on a bench reading one of those books. That felt like a small victory.

        I think it's called <em>The Secret</em> because it's meant to be somewhat ironic. If you're talking about using something concrete (the so-called "vision board") as a means of helping you visualize and define your goals, then there's nothing "secret" about it. Speakers like Dale Carnegie and Zig Ziglar have been advocating techniques like these for decades now, because they're very effective at helping people achieve their goals.<br /><br />But often times, people buy the package and not the product. Therein lies its success: the fact that the ideas were simplified, packaged into a book and documentary, and then taken onto Oprah to put the idea in front of millions of viewers who weren't even looking for it is what made it work so well. Never mind the fact that some parts of it have a pseudo-scientific air to them...the ideas are inspirational and, in the right hands, very empowering. <br /><br />More importantly, though, <em>The Secret</em> and its so-called Law of Attraction were a runaway hit for a very simple reason: the market for something to believe in is infinite. <br /><br />(Update: I finally remembered <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2004/06/27/the-hughtrain/">where that final thought came from</a>...thanks, Hugh.)

        I had a friend of mine recently ask me what I thought of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. As with most political questions being asked of me, I was completely stumped. That's not to say that I didn't have an opinion on the matter, but I still haven't learned to how respond to people when they ask me questions to which they already know the answer.<br /><br />Of course, he wanted me to reply "Man, BP is evil!" That's the way he feels, and it's the way he thinks everyone else should feel, too. He's looking for me to confirm it. If I had already had my morning coffee that day, I probably would have responded to his question with my own question: "Exactly how am I <em>supposed</em> to feel about it?"<br /><br />Politics and religion are notorious for harboring these kinds of biased opinions that rarely change, but it can happen to anyone, in any job, doing any kind of task. To a certain point, people are looking to learn more and get better at what they do. But <em>past</em> a certain point, they stop trying to learn and start falling back on what they know.<br /><br />Most people start conversations and read books looking for confirmation. They're looking for someone to tell them that they're right, that their ideas and perceptions are perfectly aligned with reality, and that they should continue to do what they've always done. Even in the face of failure, it's not often our egos incentivize us to go looking for disagreement.<br /><br />Big reveal: confirmation is worthless. Our brains are already great at confirming what we already (think we) know. When we solicit the time and advice of others, it's a waste to come away from those interactions without pausing to allow some internal dissension to creep into our heads.

        eBay was founded on a very simple principle: people are good. Of course, after only a few months of operation, it was determined that this wasn't entirely true. Most people were honest, but a few took advantage of the new online auctioning system to rip buyers off. This was typical of the early years of the Internet; people gathered at the fringes of cyberspace and didn't treat one another with respect. Are people, by their very nature, just assholes?<br /><br />It wasn't long before webmasters recognized that the problem wasn't with human nature, but with the lack of accountability. Give people a voice without holding them personally accountable for what they say and do, and the social structure quickly breaks down. eBay fixed this problem by introducing seller ratings: if you ripped someone off, the purchaser you ripped off was given the opportunity to tell everyone else about it.<br /><br />If you take away anonymity, people behave better.<br /><br />This is the reason that driving on roads and highways is such a miserable experience. It's not that people are jerks; it's just that we're all faceless to one another inside giant pods of glass and steel, and this affords us the opportunity to do all sorts of things in our interactions with other drivers. We can cut off and be cut off without any real consequences. The only real threat that keeps people in line is the slim chance that a police officer will catch us in the act, pull us over, and issue us a citation.<br /><br />Of course, the police can't everywhere at once. You can get away with quite a bit of hullabaloo behind the wheel without getting a ticket, given the right balance of caution and frivolity. (I speak from experience.)<br /><br />It would be interesting to set up a system for people to report the bad behavior of other drivers. Imagine a large, online reputation system where you could file complaints about the guy in the silver Toyota Tacoma with a certain license plate number who tailgated you for a mile, then whipped around you, cut you off, and flipped you the bird. All of these reports could be aggregated into a database and "traffic dossiers" could be built on drivers by other drivers.<br /><br />It's not as crazy as you might think. Ten years ago, any plan to replace Encyclopedia Brittanica with a large collaborative project like Wikipedia would have been laughed at. <br /><br />Imagine empowering every driver on the road to be the eyes and ears of law enforcement, and giving them the opportunity to file informal reports on their fellow drivers someplace where all those reports are aggregated. It might make drivers stop and seriously reflect about how well they're driving. Naturally, this kind of system would never replace actual police officers, but since they cannot be everywhere, it makes some sense to farm out their job to all drivers on the road.<br /><br />Such a system would be ripe for abuse; what's to stop me from filing a report about my neighbor two doors down who has all the ugly lawn ornaments? (Hypothetically...I have no such neighbor.) Software is far from perfect, but reputation systems are fairly adept at detecting disingenuous feedback. That, and if one driver receives 17 complaints related to reckless driving on the highway from 17 different people and IP addresses, it's probably a safe bet that they're a "riskier" driver.<br /><br />I've thought about building such a website, open and for public use, just to see if A) anyone would use it and B) if so, how long it would take before someone sued me over it. Sooner or later, I think someone working for some state's Department of Transportation will build one, and when it finally hits a critical mass, it will be the topic of much heated debate and controversy. Maybe it will improve things, or maybe it will just result in a new batch of problems to replace the ones it solves.

        For several decades now, Hollywood hasn't been in the business of making movies. It seems that way, because every year the cast and crew of that year's best films attend the Academy Awards ceremony and Oscars are handed out to the winners, seemingly based on the merits of the art that has been created. <br /><br />This holds true for independent filmmakers who want to make art through storytelling, a craft which is, thankfully, very much alive amongst passionate filmmakers. But the notion of Hollywood as a traditional business, where you invest money into a project in the hopes that you'll make it all back and then some, isn't quite complete.<br /><br />Hollywood isn't in the business of making movies so much as they are in the business of creating <em>properties</em>. <br /><br />They want a film that will sell out in the theaters and have a killer opening weekend. But what they're really striving for, with each movie, is to create a platform on which to hang the marketing and profitable licensing for a variety of different media channels.<br /><br /><em>Toy Story 3</em> is a great movie. Since it came out, I've seen three kids carrying around a Woody the Cowboy doll. Buzz and Woody are all over the place now. <em>Harry Potter</em> is more than just a bunch of movies that came out; they're a brand empire that's given J.K. Rowling enough money to buy Scotland.<br /><br />I'm certainly not the first person to point this out, but I would argue that the principles being used to generate oodles of money for Hollywood don't apply just to the movie industry. Take your favorite non-profit organization: in the midst of doing whatever charity is in their mission statement, they have to ask for donations.<br /><br />It's ten dollars to go see a new movie in a theater these days; it was ten dollars you could donate to Haiti in the wake of the earthquake by sending a text message that would charge your carrier and end up on your bill. But Hollywood knows better than to just charge you for a ticket and be done with it...they're interested in engaging consumers on a deeper level, so they can sell you the toy, the video game, and the DVD down the line.<br /><br />Every non-profit should be in the business of creating, following, and recruiting for a <em>mission</em>. If they do this properly, the fundraising will take care of itself.

        A few months ago, I got to see Malcolm Gladwell speak at a local theater. The subject matter was about what you would expect: a few narratives weaved together in such a way that their endings were all tied together into one tidy takeaway for the audience to reflect on, as is so typical of his effective writing style.<br /><br />What really interested me happened during the audience Q&A after his speech. The third question came from a gentleman who was clearly brimming with hostility. He asked something like: "Don't you feel, sir, that since the whole history of Keynesian economics doesn't work, that the current administration in Washington D.C. is making a huge mistake?" <br /><br />Honestly, I don't remember the question, since it had nothing to do with Gladwell's speech or anything I'd ever read in his books. But the man was clearly angry, and trying to pick a bone.<br /><br />What amazed me was Gladwell's response to the question. He proceeded to tell a story that had nothing to do with politics, but business. "I've spoken with a lot of CEO's on Wall Street, and I hear a similar complaint from a lot of them. They all wish that their performances as CEO's would be judged in a term longer than a quarter, since it's almost impossible to plan and execute a strategy in the space of three months. I would say we should give the current Presidential administration a couple more years to see what they can accomplish before we call their efforts into question."<br /><br />There are political implications here, but that's not what I'm driving at. There's no higher tact this the approach he took in answering the question. If Malcolm had simply replied, "No, jackass", then the audience would have some away from the conversation with a different impression.<br /><br />Using narrative to answer these kinds of difficult, no-win questions is great strategy, because it gets you out of the corner and lets you do so without insulting the other person's intelligence.

By his own admission, he felt under-qualified to tell the people running each of his stores what to do, so he left the stores to their own devices, without issuing a lot of top-down directives.<br /><br />Instead, he traveled around between the stores and learned from each store manager. He listened to the stories about what small processes were working, and how they was being done. He would take these success stories with him to the next store, spreading the knowledge to each manager in the hopes that it would help each of them improve their own store. It was a strategy that worked very well, and helped grow Kinko's into a nation-wide chain. (They've since been bought out by a larger company...hence the Dave Chapelle Show parody.)<br /><br />The approach is simple: find what works, and help it replicate.<br /><br />Authors Dan and Chip Heath call this finding the "bright spots". In their book <em>Switch</em>, they share the story of Jerry Sternin, then working for Save the Children, who went to Vietnam charged with the task of fighting malnutrition. He wasn't micromanaged, so the organization pretty much dumped him into a village in the jungle and told him to get to work.<br /><br />Quickly, he learned that trying to educate everyone about malnutrition was too big a task to work. Instead, he found the few children in the village who <em>weren't</em> affected by malnutrition and studied what their mothers were doing differently. Then he asked those mothers to share their knowledge with all of the others.<br /><br />Focusing on what works and trying to spread it is a great idea. As humans, we're not wired to problem-solve this way. It's easy to try and improve any system or process by weeding out all of the problems, and that's a useful strategy, but past a certain point, you just can't eliminate 100% of the problems.<br /><br />Culling the problems will thin the herd; but eventually you have to become a breeder or the herd might die out.
