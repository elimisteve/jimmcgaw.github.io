                      Fame occurs when a person has more inbound attention then they are able to respond to. It's when a person can no longer answer every single email they get, just because there aren't enough hours in their day. Or when a person goes out in public and there are strangers asking for interactions with you with a lack of an interpersonal relationship.We all have a tendency to seek out the attention and validation of famous...

                      Any assumption that starts out like that is potentially one of the most risky assumptions you can make.Lots of charities aggregate donor and volunteer contact information when they're pitching in or generously cutting them a check. Why? Because it's safe to assume that because they helped you once, or gave to you one time, that they'll want to get an email newsletter or direct mailing from your organization once a month for the rest of...

                      The drunks over at Modern Drunkard Magazine (yep, that's a real thing) came up with an interesting idea a few years ago. They're based in Denver, so they filled up a chest full of booze, stashed it someplace public in the city, and then created a series of clues which they published in their magazine. If you deciphered the clues (which would make sense only to a Denver resident), it would lead you on a...

                      Traditionally, publishing houses are supposed to act like one giant filter. Lots of authors want to get published, but only a few can. There's a limit to the number of trees we can cut down the shelf space at your local Borders. So Doubleday has to make tough decisions about which books to invest in and which to ignore. At some point literary agents made careers for themselves by acting as the go-between, adding another...

                      In theater parlance, a character in a movie acknowledging the awareness of, or speaking to the audience directly, is known as "breaking the fourth wall". It's not what John Cusack did in High Fidelity or Steve Carell talking to the camera in "The Office", but instead one of the actors breaking character and addressing the audience at some point in the story when it's unexpected.In real life, breaking character is a useful learning tool.

                      I think it's called The Secret because it's meant to be somewhat ironic. If you're talking about using something concrete (the so-called "vision board") as a means of helping you visualize and define your goals, then there's nothing "secret" about it. Speakers like Dale Carnegie and Zig Ziglar have been advocating techniques like these for decades now, because they're very effective at helping people achieve their goals.But often times, people buy the package and not...

                      I had a friend of mine recently ask me what I thought of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. As with most political questions being asked of me, I was completely stumped. That's not to say that I didn't have an opinion on the matter, but I still haven't learned to how respond to people when they ask me questions to which they already know the answer.Of course, he wanted me to...

                      eBay was founded on a very simple principle: people are good. Of course, after only a few months of operation, it was determined that this wasn't entirely true. Most people were honest, but a few took advantage of the new online auctioning system to rip buyers off. This was typical of the early years of the Internet; people gathered at the fringes of cyberspace and didn't treat one another with respect. Are people, by their...

                      For several decades now, Hollywood hasn't been in the business of making movies. It seems that way, because every year the cast and crew of that year's best films attend the Academy Awards ceremony and Oscars are handed out to the winners, seemingly based on the merits of the art that has been created. This holds true for independent filmmakers who want to make art through storytelling, a craft which is, thankfully, very much alive...

                      A few months ago, I got to see Malcolm Gladwell speak at a local theater. The subject matter was about what you would expect: a few narratives weaved together in such a way that their endings were all tied together into one tidy takeaway for the audience to reflect on, as is so typical of his effective writing style.What really interested me happened during the audience Q&A after his speech. The third question came from...
