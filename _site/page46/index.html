        The philosopher Thomas Hobbes believed that prior to modern civilization, back when all men were living in nature, they lived in what he called a "perpetual state of war". In his view, survival was the highest order of nature and the most efficient way for man to have done that, he felt, was to go around fighting all the time. His solution: create a massive police state that would keep people from fighting all the time.<br /><br />A little later, another philosopher named Jean-Jacques Rousseau responded to this claim by saying that it made little sense. Man was probably very peaceful most of the time, and used aggression only as a last resort. Rousseau said, "uh-huh" to Hobbes' "nuh-uh", and so sparked an intricate debate about man's real nature in the absence of government rule.<br /><br />I'm more inclined to agree with Rousseau, since our societies and interpersonal relationships are based on cooperation, not conflict, and that cooperation tends to be more beneficial for each of us. This is certainly true from a biological standpoint. If Hobbes is right, then in nature, I might have killed every woman I met, which would make it awfully difficult for me to pass on my genes.<br /><br />The counterintuitive conclusion is that war itself seems to be born out of cooperation just as much as conflict. Sure, fighting is predicated on conflict. But wars happen between nations, and the only way you can convince hoards of citizens to fight a war on your behalf is if you can convince them to cooperate with you, and with each other. <br /><br />If we really lived in a world where all men have a natural tendency to fight one another, the first city of Mesopotamia would have never come together in the first place.

        If you're a panhandler, and you're asking people even for just 25 cents, you're going to have a very tough time getting people to give it to you. It's just a quarter...most people have at least one of those in their pocket or purse at any given time, and few of them would miss a quarter. But asking someone to give it to you is still an uphill battle.<br /><br />However, ask someone for a minute of their time to do you a small favor and, provided they're not hurrying back to work after their lunch break, they'll probably help you. Most of us are much more willing to give time than money.<br /><br />As one of my friends once put it: "Money is an energy." People are very funny when it comes to surrendering their cold hard cash, regardless of whether it's for a homeless person or for a local charity.<br /><br />If I were homeless, I would do what author Dan Ariely suggests and panhandle for something that's "one step away from money": gift cards. Ask people if they have unused Starbucks gift cards burning a hole in their pocket. My guess it that people would be willing to part with gift cards than with money, with the added bonus that a homeless person can't generally use a gift card to buy drugs or alcohol.<br /><br />Got any leftover gift cards you don't need?

        Have you ever bought a 500 Gigabyte external hard drive, only to discover that once you formatted it, it only had around 465 Gigabytes of actual space on it? That's not some freak accident. Hard drive manufacturers have long been taking advantage of a difference between two separate ways of calculating space on a hard drive. They use decimal powers of ten in their advertisements, but the binary powers of two in the actual space computation. Notable programmer Jeff Atwood has written <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/gigabyte-decimal-vs-binary.html">an article that sums this issue up very well</a>.<br /><br />Most of us are familiar with the "computer jerk" archetype. The IT guy at your company might be dripping with the stereotypes, but it's present in an embarrassingly large number of people in the computer industry. I have to admit, over the years, I myself have probably slipped into "computer jerk" mode with a non-tech-savvy person without meaning to.<br /><br />What surprises me is that the companies that manufacture and sell hard drives haven't realized just how huge the egos of most computer people are. Often, they're the ones making the purchasing decisions at companies. More often, they're the ones making product recommendations to friends and family about which brand of anything they should buy for their computer.<br /><br />If Western Digital made a new brand of hard drive that actually held as much as advertised, I think it would be a hit among tech people. They just need to make one that holds 550 Gigs of storage space (roughly), but actually holds a little more than 500 Gigs, it would give the computer science geeks a product to tell people about, and make them feel a little superior in the process. <br /><br />"Oh, don't get the regular Western Digital; get the HonestSpace brand. You actually get the advertised number of Gigabytes with one of those. The rest of 'em, they're just ripping you off."

        There's a Sam's Club a couple of hours east of where I live that recently installed <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/05/sams-club-becomes-first-retailer-to-install-micro-wind-turbines.php">windmills on the light posts</a> in the parking lot. People have been talking about this online...a lot. It's the kind of thing people tell their neighbors about. ("Did you see those new lights at Sam's Club...?") And that's what makes it such a great idea.<br /><br />Admittedly, part of the reason this works is due to where this particular Sam's Club is located. There's no shortage of wind blowing through that area. So, there's a chance that it won't scale out to every other Sam's Club in the country.<br /><br />But I'm sure there were tons of marketers at Sam Club's headquarters doing something boring like analyzing demographics in an effort to figure out how best to spend tens of thousands of advertising dollars. Someone had the bright ideas to get some conversations started by putting windmill-powered lights in the parking lot. Which one seems less wasteful to you?<br /><br />In other news, Don Quixote decided to start shopping at Costco.

Given a reality she didn't fully understand, under circumstances that were somewhat confusing, she started paying attention to the world around her.<br /><br />I drive my car a few times a week, but I've long since stopped wondering what's happening beneath the hood. I take it for granted that there's a complex machine at work, right in my own hands. I don't need to be curious about it until my check engine light comes on.

        I imagine there was a time when a credit card was a great thing.<br /><br />Back when you had to carry around gobs of cash just to make sure you had enough to cover any expenses you might incur, it would have been nice to suddenly have a thin piece of plastic that would serve the purpose just as well. This predates me, so I can only guess at the frustration felt by millions of people as they tried to find an ATM in some obscure location in the middle of the night because they needed money.<br /><br />The credit card solved our problem.<br /><br />Then the shift came. This often happens when a company grows too big for its britches. Credit cards became big business, and now we have runaway interest rates that are gouging people. In an effort to grow, credit card companies started hyper-aggressively marketing cards to college students, knowing (or at least indifferent to the possibility) that many of them would have trouble paying them off each month. In an effort to raise profits, they actually bet on encouraging young people to go into debt.<br /><br />Good business is about solving customer's problems, not your company's problems. The reason we hate credit cards and the companies behind them is that they've long since stopped doing the former and have done the latter for so long that we no longer trust them.

        I recently went looking for computer keyboard that was completely silent. At home, my computer is in the same room as our television, so my girlfriend is stuck with the incessant clickety-click of my fingers pounding the keys. I decided to get a silent keyboard so she wouldn't have to suffer the noise pollution.<br /><br />There are keyboards that are flexible and made of rubbery material that roll up, but those keyboards aren't that great, and they just happen to be much quieter. After playing around on New Egg for a while, I asked around to see if anyone had ever heard of such a thing.<br /><br />To my surprise, I couldn't find a computer keyboard that had "silent" as one of its selling points. I imagine the reason for this is that a silent keyboard (or a silent mouse, for that matter) has never been a "buying point" for people in the market for computer supplies. When I asked some tech-savvy people about it, I asked them why they thought computer keyboards and mice should make any noise at all; in my mind, the tactile response is enough for most people to know they've clicked the button.<br /><br />It's one of those things that we've never given a second thought. Mice click, make noise, and that sound is the bane of the existence of cubicle workers everywhere. I'm hopeful Logitech will address this problem soon.

      <div class="content">
        Recently, a friend of mine tried to play matchmaker and hook up one of his close college friends with a casual acquaintance of ours. He arranged a time and place for them to meet one another, during a large social gathering that we used to have once a week. <br /><br />I thought there was a good chance it was going to work out, but my friend did make a critical error: he told both of them what he was doing. Before the meeting, he went to each of them and said, "I have a friend I'd really like to hook you up with. I think you'd be perfect for them."<br /><br />You probably know how this played out. When my friend finally got both of them into the same room, they never said one word to each other. My friend the matchmaker pointed them out to one another from across the room, but neither of them ever bothered to approach the other. Later, each of the would-be couple said they weren't interested.<br /><br />Why didn't this work? I think it's because of expectation. When your friends set you up with someone for the express purpose of initiating some kind of romantic relationship, the whole thing has a very difficult time getting off the ground because the interaction between each party is tainted by this thought. From the get-go, each person sizes up the other one's physical attributes. From there, they start scrutinizing every little thing the other person says, all the while asking themselves: "Could I ever actually date this person?"<br /><br />The problem is that my friend the matchmaker engaged the rational mind of the suitor and suitorette. Most successful relationships I know of didn't start because the two people decided to start actively seeking a romantic partner. They just <em>happened</em>. Two people were thrown into circumstances that made them get to know one another and a relationship happened to develop between them, instead of forcing circumstances to generate the relationship.<br /><br />If you're going to play matchmaker, start with the situations that bring people together. The people will work it out for themselves.

      <div class="content">
        A common aphorism in the business world is the suggestion that you "fail fast". That is, instead of spending a whole lot of time and effort on a project, just do the bare minimum and push it out to the world so you can see, based on how successful it is, if the project is really worth any more of your time and effort.<br /><br />It's true that very little comes of most things that people create, whether businesses or art projects (at least, in the financial sense.) However, "fail" is completely the wrong word to be used given the spirit of the idea. Getting something done and out the door is never a failure; refusing to do something for fear of failure is.<br /><br />Think of anything you complete as a small success. The work you do today or tomorrow may end up being inconsequential in the long haul. You might never get praise or recognition for any of those paintings you do, but each one you finish is one step closer to getting better at your craft. <br /><br />There's something to be said for completion, and the faster the better, because it beats letting an idea stew in your brain without any action. That lets you get too attached to the thought. Doing is purging...and letting go is just as important as the work itself, because it frees you up to move on to the next idea.

        I don't know about you, but whenever someone asks me what I want for Christmas or my birthday, I rarely have an answer for them. There aren't a whole lot of things that I want that I don't just go out and buy for myself as soon as I want them (usually, it's books) and I know better than to ask people for money.<br /><br />Here are some random gift ideas you might ask for, the next time someone pops the question: what do you want for your birthday? (These are not Amazon affiliate links.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBDII-Engine-Scanner-Trouble-Reader/dp/B000LEPT5G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=automotive&qid=1277587622&sr=8-2">Automotive Code Reader</a> - When your "Check Engine" light comes on, your car is basically telling you the computer logged an error. If you want to be able to determine what the error is without taking it to a repair shop, you can buy one of these things, plug it in under your dashboard, and easily find out yourself. They can be somewhat cryptic by themselves, but a little Googling should help you determine how urgent the problem is. I was one hour into the six-hour drive from LA to Vegas when my check engine light came on...thanks to this gadget I had in my trunk, I was able to gauge that I didn't need to find a mechanic <em>right away</em>. (Note: cars older than 1993 require a different type of scanner.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-ICD-PX820-Digital-Voice-Recorder/dp/B00387E5BM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1277588037&sr=8-1">Sony Digital Voice Recorder</a> - If you're an idea person, you can't always count on being close to pen and paper or a computer, or being able to get your ideas down before they vanish from your head. The quickest way to log ideas is by recording them down as quick as you can. I own this exact one I've linked to, and I use it daily. (Some days, I use it hourly.) This one is great quality, and you can dump the audio files from the device directly onto your computer in MP3 format. I'd highly recommend this for any aspiring musicians.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Portable-External-HDDR500E04XL-Liquid/dp/B002BW6DBU/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1277588321&sr=8-17">External Hard Drive (USB)</a> - For anyone who's ever had their computer's hard drive take a crap, this one needs no explanation. Get your hands on one of these, and back up all your music, video, photo, and document files for safe keeping somewhere other than your computer. You can thank me later.
