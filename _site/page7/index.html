        A few weeks ago, I left the life that I had cultivated in Santa Barbara. I did this knowing that I probably wouldn't be returning to that life ever again, and with a heavy heart. Naturally, like any person facing change, I resisted and heavily challenged the wisdom of this decision in my head and heart. But to paraphrase the old Magic 8-Ball: all signs were pointing to "yes". And by "yes", I mean "get out now".<br /><br />When I left my job, people asked me where I was headed next, and what my plan was. My response was honest: "I don't know." I quickly learned that people are incredibly uncomfortable in the face of this kind of uncertainty. I'm tied to very few people, own very little, and have an oddly simple lifestyle; I'm incredibly fortunate that I have the freedom in my life to make this kind of move.<br /><br />In the short-term, I decided to head to Arizona. I had a grandmother in the final stages of dementia, who had recently entered hospice care, and I wanted to spend some time with her. When I arrived, I went to see her; she actually recognized who I was when my aunt told her I had come to visit. "Jimmy!" she exclaimed excitedly, looking up at me from her wheelchair with her prototypical, energetic cheerfulness. In subsequent visits, she failed to recognize who I was. A week after I arrived, she passed away.<br /><br />I've been living alone for the past week, which is a new experience for me. Freed from work, and the pressures of social media, for the first time in a long time, approaching any kind of computer is completely optional for me. After having been a software engineer for years, this is a blessing. I've surrounded myself with books, and am sincerely grateful for the time I've been able to spend seeking wisdom from paper and not any kind of screen.<br /><br />I'm confronting the question that I imagine strikes everyone at some point in their lives. As you grow up and become an adult, you naturally have to put aside parts of yourself; you take on characteristics that allow you to become enmeshed with other people and in the culture of the world. Here's the question: where does the true me end, and what I've turned myself into begin?<br /><br />Ruminating on this, I've come to wonder if this question is even worth exploring. I'm not convinced that any of us have an identity that is truly separate from our relationships with others. Am I anything other than what I've become in the context of the other people in my life?<br /><br />Relationships have always been a struggle for me. Perhaps I overvalue my sense of individuality, but I'm extremely wary of letting my own identify be defined in opposition to anything else. The world is full of people who will approach you and attempt to bond with you over what they perceive as a common enemy. People in churches will bring you into the fold so you can talk about how much better you are than people who don't share your religion (or worse, people who don't share the same denomination.) People in political groups will attempt to bring you in so you can talk about how much better you are than the "other guys".<br /><br />Those are extreme examples of large groups. Sometimes it's just a person approaching you and wanted to share a hatred of something. To paraphrase another example: "Having a job sucks, having a boss sucks, don't you agree? Corporate America sucks, don't you agree? Women are all after men's money, don't you agree? C'mon," they gently and subtly goad you, implying that you should agree so then they can draw a line between you and everyone else, and base your conversations on that. In the most egregious cases, the target of the gossip isn't another group, but an individual who's being singled out and excluded for some reason.<br /><br />I certainly can't say I've never gone along with this kind of conversation; in my youth, desperate to make connections with people, I didn't refute the opinions of others; sometimes I shared them as if they were my own. But I didn't like they way they tasted, simply because they didn't represent me or how I really felt, so I abandoned them. I'm also not saying all people are like this, or that all people are terrible, but I've found it difficult to establish relationships with people if you shun this kind of thing, since most of us define ourselves by the groups we identify with, and the lines we draw between those groups and others. Common ground is shaky when it's based on a schism of some kind.<br /><br />I believe it was Nietzsche who said that shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings. Perhaps I've merely allowed too little joy into my life.<br /><br />All of my adult life, I've tried to resist allowing myself to be defined this way. Here's a handful of examples: in high school, I bounced around between different social groups. I was in band for all four years, and while I had friends, I never felt I identified with any of the cliques that formed within that group. I joined theater as a techie for a couple of productions. For a stint in 11th grade, I hung out with the "freaks and geeks" and attended their parties. I shared a class my senior year with some of guys on the school's football team, and while I never really befriended any of them, I was surprised to find that I identified with their take on life more than anyone else's I had encountered in school.<br /><br />In short, I never really felt I fit in anywhere. I also actively resisted the desire to become part of any one group, because my endless curiosity drove me to seek out the experience of being in other groups. I don't think this is uncommon for high schoolers, but I made an effort to do it in college and in my work life as well. As soon as I feel the "Gobble gobble, one of us!" chant arising from a group I've associated with, I turn to flee. I've been nothing if not avoidant.<br /><br />This has been both a curse and a blessing. It leads you to feel extremely isolated, and doesn't allow you to feel that you belong anywhere in the world. As you confront life's challenges, you feel like you're walking down an empty hallway, unsure of where it's leading, and you have nothing else to guide you but the sound of your own footsteps echoing back from the walls.<br /><br />At the same time, it's been incredibly valuable to get different perspectives on life from an extremely diverse set of people. I love connecting with individuals, and I love that I can try to see a person for who they are, and not merely the group they're a part of. When someone tells me their perspective on something, I can consider it fully, and still be aware that it's one perspective among potentially several others. When I hold an opinion in my head, I know full well that someone out there would disagree with me, and for good reasons; this has led to me seek alternate perspectives on things, and to seek to understand those reasons. In my better moments, it's allowed me flexibility when life demands it, and to avoid taking myself too seriously.<br /><br />But still, there is the ever-present sense of loneliness. Perhaps eschewing labels and acceptance as part of any one group is eschewing any kind of identity that matters. To borrow from the Ubuntu philosophy: a person is a person because of other people. I might never decide to let myself get nailed down with certain labels, simply because many of these labels are divisive, and these divisions do more to hurt us and our humanity more than they do to help them. But to avoid making a choice is, as they say, still a choice.<br /><br />I've learned that I will screw up; usually in small ways, sometimes in big ways. When this happens, sometimes I just have to run away and collect myself again. But nothing stops me from coming back to the table, putting my chips down, and playing the game. We are all human, we all have the privilege of playing this game with each other, and, win or lose, I've loved playing every hand that I've been dealt.

        My father has a concept that he likes to share with me often. He calls it the "jerk factor". It's quite simple: in any given circumstance, in the absence of rules, there is a subset of people in the population (the "jerks") that will abuse the lack of rules. This will lead to rules being established. If there are established rules, then the jerks will abuse any leniency in the rules. This will lead to the rules being tightened.<br /><br />In short: most people are reasonable and exercise good behavior, but there is a small minority of selfish people who ruin having complete freedom for everyone else. Presumably, if you accept this premise, then all authority exists to keep this minority from hurting others, or themselves.<br /><br />Many years ago, I read a book by noted skeptic Michael Shermer. In it, he claims that one of the harms wrought on society by organized religion is the externalization of evil. This is summed up in the dismissive aphorism that someone might offer after they've been caught doing something bad: "the devil made me do it". (It's been a while since I read the book, and the title escapes me, so apologies to Shermer if I'm doing his point injustice by oversimplifying.)<br /><br />The danger is in the shirking of personal responsibility. It's not my fault! We point the finger at devil on our shoulder. I'm certainly not a perfect person; I understand that this little Lucifer has whispered in my own ear plenty of times and caused me to do stupid things, so I don't think this excuse is inherently evil. What I'd ask of anyone playing this card (including myself) is some assurance that they've learned to recognize his voice, so they can ignore it the next time he speaks up.<br /><br />More recently, I learned that some religious people do the very opposite: they externalize the source of their own good actions. I read a nighttime prayer someplace last year (its source escapes me now) that goes something like this: "Lord, anything good I did today that served You came from You; thank You for guiding me. If I did anything bad, not in accordance with Your wishes, it was my fault. Please help me do better tomorrow."<br /><br />This is more succinctly summed up in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector praying in the temple: "The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.' But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God." (Luke 18:10-14)<br /><br />The same danger exists here, but in the opposite direction: if you pray as the tax collector does, if you define yourself as a sinner, then you externalize all of the good you've done. Perhaps, to be more gentle on ourselves, they prayer should read: "Have mercy on me, a good person who sins."<br />        <br />Positive psychology distinguishes optimistic people from pessimistic ones very simply: optimists attribute their good fortune to their character and their bad fortune to their circumstances, while pessimists do the very opposite. Given this criteria, the risk of doing what the optimist does is becoming haughty; at the other extreme, the risk of doing what the pessimist does is becoming depressed. Either way, it's risky to define yourself as either absolute, and relegating the responsibility for your actions that are inconsistent with this absolute, to some external influence.<br /><br />I try not to be a jerk. When I am one, I try to recognize it, and be less of a jerk the next day. My hope is that, on my deathbed, the voice of the jerk inside of me will have been reduced to little more than white noise.

        When King Solomon prayed, he never asked for wealth, power, status, or women. Instead, he asked for the one thing that he felt more valuable above all else: wisdom.<br /><br />In evaluating our experiences, the question that we should ask ourselves is not, "Why did this happen?" or "Whose fault is this?" but rather: <i>"What have I learned?"</i>

        It's been over 10 years since I last finished reading George Orwell's dystopian novel&nbsp;<i>1984</i>. Books taste different on your palette depending on the age you are. What follows is actually the thoughts I had after finishing the book several lifetimes ago. If I read the book now, I'm sure my takeaways would be starkly different. So, you're about to hear from 20-year-old me. If you haven't read <i>1984</i>, I suggest you stop reading; my point here is not worth the spoiler.<br /><br />One of the themes of the book is that as governments consolidate power, there is a tendency to abuse it. To paraphrase science fiction writer David Brin, in a spin on the old maxim: absolute power does not corrupt, but it attracts the corruptible. This aspect of the book is fairly well known; the term "Big Brother" is synonymous with a police state maintained with constant surveillance and thought control.<br /><br />Less well known, in my experience as a non-literary analyst, are the details behind the novel's ending. The protagonist, Winston Smith, tries to stand up to the totalitarian government. In the latter part of the book, he is imprisoned and tortured in an attempt to brainwash him into compliance.<br /><br />Ultimately, Winston's spirit is broken, and he succumbs to the authority of the state. They do this, in the end, by threatening him with the thing he fears most. (His biggest fear is rats.) In a panic, he tries to escape it by insisting they inflict the object of his fear on the woman he loves.<br /><br />What modern civilization has instilled in us so deeply, there is something instinctual that goes deeper still. Call it a primal reaction. All of these are based on the one factor in human nature driving the course of evolution: survival. These fears control us; in their defense, these fears are doing it for our own good, and to some extent, we can control them. But every person has a breaking point.<br /><br />If this is true, then anyone can be corrupted, and so anyone can, under the right circumstances, abandon their humanity. We can be stripped of our civilized selves. Totalitarian Big Brother may subvert me for his own ends. I might object on moral grounds, but if he can demonstrate to me that I would do the same right back to Big Brother if our roles were reversed, then no one individual can truly claim to be on moral high ground over any other. If I can be corrupted into being a Big Brother myself, then why would I cling to my own ideals?<br /><br />On the surface, the book appears to decry the existence of governments; referring to a government as "Big Brother" is never favorable. And yet if our animal nature truly lurks just beneath the surface, cloaked only by a civilization that shields us from the threat of death from one another, then submission to some kind of overarching authority is necessary to protect us from ourselves.<br /><br />For me, this is the dangling question: what is the benefit of a civilization controlled by a government using the laws of nature to subjugate people, over no civilization and no government with a population that operates according to these same laws of nature?

        More recently, I've been told that I have a tendency to idealize other people. I absolutely do this, for the simple reason that I want to find and emphasize the good in everyone.<br /><br />In high school, I found myself surrounded by friends and acquaintances who would tear other people down behind their backs, even as they smiled to their faces. Being exposed to this, I found it was a habit I readily picked up and carried with me for much of my formative adult life. I've felt firsthand how this can be destructive to one's relationships with others; for the last few years, I've made an effort to overcompensate in the other direction.<br /><br />Naturally, I'm keenly aware that there's a balance to all of this. There is good in everyone, but that doesn't mean I go around handing out copies of the keys to my house to everyone that I encounter. Just as the good exists, there is bad in everyone. People put forth a likable veneer with others in an effort to mask the ugly underneath.<br /><br />It's not that I'm oblivious to the fact that people have shortcomings; everyone does. But in general, there is more good in people than bad. Almost all people are aware of their own faults, and are making some effort to work on these faults. It does them and me very little good if I expend a lot of energy dwelling on them. A person who is unaware of their own faults is unlikely to vary their behavior or awareness if I point them out.<br /><br />Now, I always embark on the possibility of a relationship with the knowledge that the other person isn't going to be perfect; I expect the other person to approach me with the same mindset. It feels very belittling not to be seen for who you are. Too much idealism, and you feel pressure to live up to something you cannot possibly live up to. Too much realism, and you wonder why the other person is so focused on your faults. As the old song goes: "Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood!"<br /><br />I've dealt with a large number of people from all walks of life over the past few years; certainly more people than I ever expected to come into my life. Most people seem to feel that I'm a likable person, and we get along just fine. I've certainly met people who didn't like me at all; that's understandable, because I'm definitely imperfect, and there are people who simply won't care for me. This rarely affects my opinion of them; even if someone chooses to despise me, I still choose to like them.<br /><br />By the same token, even though I choose to like everyone, and make a conscious effort to find the good in them, I don't let everyone into my life without any discernment. There's not always the possibility for a win-win relationship.<br /><br />I used to get very anxious when I met someone who didn't like me. Now, I just appreciate that other people are willing to help me filter out the people who don't belong in my life. If I had to do all of that myself, it would be terribly exhausting!

        A couple of months ago, I got a new pair of glasses. It wasn't that my prescription had changed much, but I had been wearing the old pair for so long that the lenses were covered in aberrations. While this doesn't really hinder your ability to see, it can make it difficult to see things clearly. It's easy to get complacent and believe you have clarity in your perception of things, especially when all of the scratches on the lenses have aggregated slowly over an extended period of time.<br /><br />Sometimes you just need to force yourself to get new glasses, even if it's time you feel could be better spent doing anything else. Even if you've gotten used to way you think you look in the mirror.<br /><br />I was asked recently what my values are, and where they came from. I had never given this a great deal of thought. Like most people, my values came from my upbringing and the set of experiences that I have had since then, but these have been internalized within myself, and never formally brought to light to be examined.<br /><br />Very recently, I decided that one absolutely must be explicit in this process. It's easy to let your own sense of your values emerge naturally from your behavior. Your behavior proceeds from who you are. This is the approach I've always taken; for the most part, I am who I have always been. This has led me to behave a certain way. An onlooker (like myself) could determine what my values are from how I act.<br /><br />I'm sure there are gobs of self-help books that touch upon this very thing, and like most of the trite points I make in my writing, I'm not going to let this stop me, or try to pretend as though I'm saying anything new.<br /><br />In brief, I've come to believe from bitter experience that this flow of who we are to how we act to value determination is backwards. Values must be decided upon in advance; actions should proceed from these; it is from these actions that one's character is determined.<br /><br />So what are my values? I'm still figuring this out, but life has taught me some very important lessons in the last couple of months, albeit in what seems to be a very odd and roundabout way.<br /><br /><i>Honesty</i>: in recent months I've been the victim of duplicity by people close to me, and have caused others harm by my own duplicity. There are probably situations that call for little white lies, perhaps to the spare feelings of others. Where this line is seems to be a recurring theme in narratives. To lie with the intent of manipulating others to self-serving ends is wrong. If you cannot be fully honest with yourself first, you cannot be fully honest with others.<br /><br /><i>Courage</i>: while I've always been fond of sitting and staring out the window, reflecting on what I've read, philosophizing about right and wrong, it means little if you don't stand up and take action on behalf of what you think is right. I'm not going to set the dividing line between right and wrong correctly in all circumstances, but this uncertainty on my part is a poor excuse for passively allowing what I think is wrong to continue. Subjectivity be damned; right must make might.<br /><br /><i>Fidelity</i>: I just got out of a 12 year relationship. In hindsight, I know now that I let my own eyes wander too much during this time period. I recently read <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, a brutally honest book about the human condition as it concerns our foibles in romantic relationships. In it, the author espouses the benefit of fidelity in roughly these words: that it coalesces into a single, unified whole what would otherwise be a lifetime of thousands of split-second, capricious impressions. At the risk of moralizing, the latter damages us. To escape this trap of human nature, and embrace seeing only one, is among the most wonderful things we can experience.<br /><br />Life is most beautiful when the sun is shining, but you can only fully appreciate this beauty if you see things clearly.

        Honesty is a difficult thing to define clearly. If you ask someone a question when you know that answer is "yes", but they tell you "no", that's clearly dishonesty. But the world is complicated. In some circumstances the lie can be simple while the truth complex, and it can also be the reverse, so they can be difficult to tell apart. We learn from our cultural upbringings that lying is often called for, for the sake of polite society. How can a person strive to be honest?<br /><br />Well, like most things, I really have no idea, but that's never stopped me from writing. Here's my guess: truth is scattered. We all have a small slice of perspective on the reality we inhabit, in time and space. We don't know truth; we only know the tiny portion we experience. Everyone experiences a different slice. Everyone brings their own biases and distortions in their interpretation and understanding of their slice.<br /><br />Perhaps wisdom is the ability of an individual to truly understand their tiny reality without letting their biases interfere, and to see clearly how it affects the realities of others. This is distinct from honesty. We should seek to be wise, but that really only comes with experience, and we need to be honest in the meantime.<br /><br />What matters is that we use our limited and imperfect understanding of our tiny reality on which to base our sense of identity. We assimilate it to aid us in decision-making, in how we interpret and act on our emotions, and in our relationships with others.<br /><br />I'm not a psychologist, and I know nothing about any of this, but I believe the surest indication of possible deception is not when a person tells a flat-out lie to get something they want, or avoid something they fear. It is when a person is inconsistent in applying their internalized sense of reality to the world around them. It is when the emotions on a person's face don't match their words. When actions don't match lip service. I would guess that these are indications of inner conflict, which might not necessarily indicate deceit.<br /><br />So how to practice being honest? Know that we are all, each of us, full of crap. Know that you are full of crap, so take care not to hurt anyone. Try to become less full of crap as time goes on. Above all: strive to be consistent in how you apply your own personal crap to the world around you.

        Over the course of my adult life, there is a conversation that people keep bringing up to me. Here is the idea, simply: that civilization shields humankind from the elements of nature. Nature is cruel, and the highest law is survival of the fittest, which can only be carried out by killing the unfit before they can contribute to the gene pool. This protection afforded humankind by civilized society means that the weak survive, whereas in an alternate, more “natural” environment, the weak might be weeded out by natural forces.<br /><br />This idea sounds Darwinian, but the idea predates him by a long shot. Malthus wrote about the constraints of the planet to support humans on it, and the notion that population growth might one day outpace our ability to supply resources to the entire population. (The so-called “Malthusian catastrophe”.) Roughly a century after he expressed this concern, Western civilization decided to take it upon itself to cull out “the weak” from society, in an effort to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring.<br /><br />This lead to the terrible blemish in American history which is known as the eugenics movement. Since the idea of getting rid of “the weak” was devised by people from wealth and privilege, it invariably played out that the poor and less abled were the ones who were deemed unfit. It was among the lower social classes that people found themselves being forcibly sterilized.<br /><br />For all of the horrors that this idea has caused, it seems that people still casually toss around the idea that civilization might be preventing natural selection from occurring, which is a detriment to the species overall. I don’t understand why people cling to this notion. It does raise what might be a momentarily interesting question: society might thwart nature’s raw mechanisms; what are the possible consequences of this?<br /><br />When someone poses this idea to me, I ask them to define who they feel “the weak” are. Is it based on money? Power? What kind of power? What is the benefit of eliminating this segment of society? And so on. I usually end the conversation by asking them to convince me that they themselves are not part of “the weak” caste they describe. It never gets me any closer to understanding the truth, but their answers tell me what criteria this person uses to divide up human beings. Nothing tells you more about a person than how they choose to divide people.

      <div class="content">
        I spent a good deal of time yesterday, while traveling back to California, reflecting on the horrors I had caused during my visit to my home state. In hindsight, and in a larger context, things make a great deal more sense now.<br /><br />A person who reads my <a href="/2016/02/17/the-accidental-cyberstalker.html">last blog post</a> might wonder why on earth I suddenly ventured across the country in an effort to explore the possibility of romance with a girl I barely knew. This is the honest truth: something told me to pursue that course.<br /><br />By "something", I have no idea what exactly I mean. I felt the calling to do it. I recognized that I am an idiot about two years ago, and that the sheer volume of what I don't know about the entirety of this world inspires humility in me. I learned quickly the importance of deference to something other than myself or my urges and emotions...but deference to what I cannot say.<br /><br />I often retire to the mountains, to be among nature, for long stretches of time, during which I commune with this something, this otherness, separate from myself. It might be nature, it might be God; it is something I know that I don't understand and cannot define; and this is itself important. It is a constant reminder of how important this deference is, because I don't know everything.<br /><br />My roommate asked me before I went back to my home state for this visit why I was going. I replied, quickly, simply, and with conviction: "To be judged." That was all I said, and he felt this was cryptic enough that he didn't need or want to inquire further. I meant this; the journey I was supposed to go on was to reveal something about myself. If I explored the possibility of romance with this girl, then there would be an important lesson for me to learn from her response. Perhaps, if the whole thing did work out, then I perhaps I was meant be a faithful partner to her. Perhaps I would be killed in a car accident on the drive down to see her. If things didn't work out, and we weren't compatible (and it turned that out we most certainly aren't), then there would be something to learn from that as well.<br /><br />Or, perhaps, I really was just seeking after some carnal desire, and I was using this sense of a "quest" as an intellectual justification. The hardest thing to understand is oneself.<br /><br />I've always been something of a rebel; whatever the established rules and order are, I like to do the opposite. I've come to learn that the world is largely full of selfish people, who largely care almost entirely for themselves. In rebellion against this truth, in the last year I have made every effort to be kind, generous, and caring with others in every walk of my life. I do things that people don't understand; they do not grasp my motives. Paradoxically, this has actually led to more rejection in my life than being self-seeking ever did, because people shun what they don't understand. They might appreciate it; some take advantage of it; but almost all shun it.<br /><br />So I went back to my home state to meet with this girl, and, as I said, "to be judged". What was the verdict? That I can be an evil person capable of causing evil to happen to those around me.<br /><br />In the last year of trying to do good in this world, to be a counterexample to the general rule of terrible human nature, it has been a mistake for me to think, even for a second, that I should be working to overcome the evil that is being wrought in the world by others. I am not the shining counterexample of acting altruistically in a world possessed by those who are selfish. Instead I must strive diligently to overcome the evil that exists within myself. Because it <i>is</i>&nbsp;there, fully present inside of myself, and unless I focus all of my efforts on eliminating that, I will always be incapable of doing anything truly good in this world. No one, however much good they are trying to do, is above the rules.<br /><br />Before I went on this trip, I only asked for one thing: that whatever happened, I wouldn't leave anyone behind me worse off than I had found them. I didn't care what happened, because the point of any kind of spiritual journey is not to get what you want, but rather to accept truth as it is revealed to you. I never want to do anything bad to others; this is, above all, my sole mission in life: to leave others behind me in my wake at least no worse off than I found them, but ideally better. In this case I failed spectacularly. While I feel terrible about this, I can't change what I did, so the only thing I can truly do with this information going forward is to learn from it.<br /><br />Even if it was just me seeking after a pretty girl, well, I went into it knowing that it was a girl I truly knew nothing about, so I couldn't actually bring myself to hope that things would work out. One doesn't try to stack the deck without knowing what's truly at play in the game. If this was all it was, then I got a pretty simple answer, both from her directly, and from the errors in communication we experienced that clearly indicated how constructively our wavelengths interfered with each other. I hope she never sees me again.<br /><br />The biggest lesson I took away from all of this is this: that it is a grave mistake to confuse the desire to sacrifice for others as any kind of romantic love. I do feel the urge to be compassionate in this world, and to do good for others, but this is clearly very separate from romantic love. I don't know the difference between the two, and at the very least, I am not ready for or capable of romantic love. That I see this distinction plainly now is liberating.<br /><br />I deeply regret my actions and the terrible manner in which they affected others. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I'm a resident in its clutches for the foreseeable future.
