      <div class="content">
        A German engineering company developed a spoon, to which even the most viscous liquids will not stick. You can dip it into honey, and they honey will roll right off without leaving a trace. The actual composition of the surface of the spoon is based on the properties of the leaves of the lotus flower. Even liquids like glue will roll right off the surface of the leaf.<br/><br/>Here's the company website, as well as a couple picture demonstrating the "Lotus effect" in action: <a href="http://www.lotus-effekt.de/en/funktion/fluessig.php">Lotus Effect spoon pictures</a>.<br/><br/>From their FAQ page, here is one question, which also happens to be the exact question that led me to their website in the first place:<br/><br/>"Where is the Lotus-Effect® spoon available for sale?"<br/><br/>To which they politely reply:<br/><br/>"For demonstrations we employ a spoon with a perfect Lotus-Effect® surface. Honey and many other substances roll off without a hint of residue. The spoon is a prototype that is, unfortunately, not for sale."<br/><br/>Okay, let me see if I understand this correctly: your company is in possession of a patented technology, you developed a product with it, one of your frequently asked questions is <em>where can I buy that product</em>, and you refuse to mass produce it and sell it to people?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not supposed to understand.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I don't know what their long-term strategy is as a company, but it makes little sense to me that they would keep this kind of thing cooped up and hidden behind the legal red tape of patents and registered trademarks, especially if there's visible demand for it.<br/><br/>The company has applied the technology to cans of paint for use in the exteriors of buildings and that they're trying to sell it to builders who are interested in keeping moisture and dirt from creeping into their building materials. The so-called "Lotusan paint" is also not something you can just stroll into Home Depot and buy.<br/><br/>I see why they're guarding the whole "secret" so carefully, but it makes very little sense to keep this kind of technology proprietary. Instead of taking the time, effort, and imagination to brand itself well, they're just taking tiny, timid steps to introduce the product and keeping their competitive edge with the patents.<br/><br/>I think it's a losing strategy. If I were in their position, here's two things I would do:<br/><br/>1. Produce a bunch of Lotus-Effect spoons and give them away to people. Put the name of the company and the website on it. People will love the spoon and they'll show their friends. It will generate interest in the product.<br/><br/>2. License the technology behind the paint to one (or maybe even a few) of the major paint manufacturers and let them figure out how to market it to people who want to paint the outside of their houses with it. They already know how to distribute it, so there's no need to reinvent the wheel. When it takes off and becomes mainstream, everyone makes money. The challenge lies in getting enough produced to meet demand.<br/><br/>At the very least, start selling the spoons. I'm trying to imagine a crazy, mixed-up world where OXO has a prototype for a new, revolutionary new can opener and there's an FAQ on their site: "Where can I buy that fancy new can opener?"<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, OXO doesn't want to sell you that. Take your money and piss off."

        Three years ago, I went to Las Vegas for the first time, and I was very surprised at what I discovered there.<br/><br/>Nothing worth talking about.<br/><br/>I'm not the first person to venture into "The Entertainment Capital of the World" and come away confused about it how it developed that reputation. I've spoken to several other people who spent a few days in Vegas and, after wandering around on the strip and seeing a show, came away without any clue about the city's appeal.<br/><br/>I'm astonished at how much the <em>same</em> all the casinos are. Sure, each of them has a different theme, like Treasure Island, Paris, and MGM Grand, etc, but inside, all of them are identical. Once you get past the decor and the initial branding in the lobby, there's very little in the casinos that differentiates any of them from all of the others.<br/><br/>The experience in every casino is made of "ticky-tacky". They all have the same machines, the same table games, the same watresses walking around handing out free drinks, the same call girls hovering around the bar, the same flashy lights, the same lure of the frequent gambler's card, comping the high rollers, and so on. They're all the same. Innately, nothing makes you want to go to one casino over another. They do nothing to differentiate themselves from one another.<br/><br/>I suppose this works for them. Branding is just image-deep. It's superficial, and they make money because people come to Vegas in hoards, ready to experience the city just because it's Vegas. To them, the financial success is a given, so you don't have to do much besides build a pretty place and let people come in. It's a lazy marketer's dream because you don't have to do actually <em>do</em> anything.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that none of them has even tried anything new in the last 50 years. Here's a quick exercise: I'll describe a game and you tell me what it is. <br/><br/>1. It's a machine that's got wheels with pictures on them and a lever you pull to make the wheels spin. They stop spinning at random times. If you get the same three, four, or five things in a row, you win. What is it? Slots, of course.<br/><br/>2. What's the game you play at a table against the dealer? There are a few, but the first one that came to your mind was probably Blackjack. Those Pai-Gow tables are empty and full of dealers paying their dues for no tips.<br/><br/>3. What's the table game that you play with cards against several other people? Poker. (If you've been paying attention the last ten years, you probably said something more specific, like Hold 'em.)<br/><br/>I just described 95% of what you find in Vegas. They're popular and they're what people expect, so they're very prevalent. But why haven't these things changed in the last 50 years? Sure, slots have gone digital and now have 5 wheels instead of just 3. And it used to be 5-card Draw, not No Limit Hold 'em. Why has no one bothered to even try creating a new kind of game? Why not one you play with your feet, like DDR? Okay, bad idea...my only point is, why are they all table games and machine games?<br/><br/>I think if one of the casinos chooses to break the "Little Box" mold and do something truly unique, they'll win big. What happens in Vegas doesn't stay there. People would tell their friends.

        I spend a lot of time shopping and spending money on books on Amazon.com. They do an absolutely great job making product recommendations to me. I've actually spent more money because their cross-selling algorithm is so effective at determining what I want.<br/><br/>Contrast this with Borders. Borders made me get this annoying "Borders Rewards" card that they make me haul around on my keys to get discounts and coupons from them. As an individual, they know what I'm buying is mostly computer books. In all of the emails from Borders, I've never gotten a notice about the new computer books coming out.<br/><br/>The same is true with Barnes & Noble. Here's another blogger named Jon Dale saying exactly the same thing I am: <a href="http://www.jondale.com/blog/2008/05/why-we-love-ema.html">Why We Love Email from Amazon and Hate Email from Barnes & Noble</a>. He contends that because Barnes & Noble doesn't do directed mailings, their emails get treated like spam. He's absolutely right.<br/><br/>Jon Dale wrote that blog post almost two years ago. In my estimation, very little has been done to improve the situation since then. Which begs the question: are they even listening to what people are saying? I don't know about you, but I love books, and I love getting new ideas, and I love hanging out in Borders for long stretches of time looking for an excuse to buy something. Most people like me are rooting for Borders and hope that they emerge from this horrible economic situation, because if they don't, we'll have no place else to loiter on the weekend and buy the books we don't want to wait for Amazon to ship to us.<br/><br/>Time was, people voiced their opinions with their wallets. The only way Borders and B&N could figure out what titles to stock was by counting how many sold, and then stocking the ones that sold a lot of copies. That's why almost every book says "Bestseller" on the cover, even though that long ago stopped differentiating them from one another.<br/><br/>But now, they can track individual purchases and do more directed marketing, and they're not. What's more, customers are happily voicing their suggestions in the blogosphere and they're being ignored. Is it any wonder, then, that they're struggling to make money?

      <div class="content">
        Here's a recent status update from a friend of mine on Facebook:<br/><br/>"If I've said it once, I'll say it a kazillion times...Apple is the BEST company EVER! Yeah, they're more expensive, but at least in this case, you definitely get what you pay for-it's TOTALLY worth it! Hooray, hooray!!"<br/><br/>Apple fans rave about their products, and love telling their stories about great customer service. But is that really all there is to it? Is a great product enough to get people to say things like this about you on Facebook to their friends? I like Diet Coke because it's a tasty, great product, but don't Tweet about it. I like Starbucks coffee, but I'm not about to rave about it through social media.<br/><br/>What this kind of Apple fanaticism indicates to me is that Apple is doing more than just providing great products: they're relieving pain. In the race to commoditize PCs and make them cheaper, Microsoft and hardware manufacturers had to cut corners in areas like customer service, and they do deals with companies like Norton, so that you get a machine with a massive antivirus program installed and they tell you to keep it installed and running all the time or else a virus will eat your hard drive and, oh, yes, while we have you on the line, would you like to buy any other fancy Norton products?<br/><br/>It's a mess. PC and Windows has been in steady decline in people's minds for years. I've almost never heard an ordinary person (e.g. a "non-geek") say anything good about purchasing a computer from Dell.<br/><br/>Apple moved in. They can charge a premium because they're helping reduce the sting of buying and maintaining a new computer. And more people think they're worth it. Now the question remains: is it possible for a PC manufacturer selling home computers with pre-installed Windows on them create this kind of image in consumer's minds? With all of the negative street cred, how would they do it?<br/><br/>It's a tough question, and there's not an easy solution. That's the challenge of branding.

        Last night, my girlfriend and I were hanging around in Borders, looking for a book that she was interested in reading. After having looked it up in their computer, we spent about ten minutes wandering around the section it was supposedly located in, trying to narrow down exactly where it was.<br/><br/>After a while, I started looking around for an employee to help us out, and I became aware of the black bubbles on the ceiling that contain surveillance cameras. A thought occurred to me: traditionally, the employees at Borders walk around doing their jobs, and sometimes, they ask me and other shoppers if I need any help finding anything. Most of the time, people (myself included) just say "No, thank you," and life goes on.<br/><br/>But, if you're a security guard, and you have an eye in the sky, then you would have a much easier time spotting the customers that are actually lost and really need help. It's not difficult; yesterday, when I started feeling lost, I started <em>appearing</em> lost, wandering around aimlessly with a purpose, but not any specific direction. I looked around a lot.<br/><br/>Chances are good that no employee is actually sitting there at Borders in front of a bank of monitors watching customers for the purpose of security. But since they have the infrastructure in place, why not let customer service use it? Set up a dispatcher to watch customers, spot the ones that appear to need help, and give them a means to tell employees which of the customers they should try to assist.<br/><br/>If you went so far as to tell people that's what the cameras are there for, instead of making them feel like they're being monitored for security reasons, they might actually appreciate the presence of the cameras instead of feeling like crooks.

        I've always thought that if you were in Marketing or Advertising, that every single show on network television would suddenly turn into the Super Bowl. Instead of muting the commercials or ignoring them, you'd pay attention because you'd be looking for inspiration or critique the commercials for their effectiveness. As of late, I've been studying marketing concepts, mostly because of my interest in the value of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing">Social Marketing</a>, so when the television is on in the background, I actually have been paying attention to the ads on TV.<br/><br/>I just saw one of the best commercials that I've seen in years. It was for the American Red Cross, a nonprofit organization that offers disaster relief and takes blood donations. Here's how it goes: it shows a ludicrous shot of a bunch of people dancing in a really goofy fashion to an upbeat song called "It Takes Two". Two of the people come into the foreground and the camera cuts to each of them, one at a time, up close. Text is shown for each of them next to their close-up shot on the screen.<br/><br/>The first: "Needed blood."<br/><br/>The second: "Donated blood."<br/><br/>Back to all of the people dancing. Two more emerge, and we see them up close with:<br/><br/>"Needed CPR."<br/><br/>"Knew CPR."<br/><br/>Dancing again. The whole thing has such a silly air that I'm trying not to laugh at it. I feel like I shouldn't laugh at it because there's no reason it should be funny, so I'm a little ashamed of myself. Part of it was that the pairings were illogical. One of them was a young white man and a middle-aged Indian woman. Two more people come forth, the last ones, and their stories read:<br/><br/>"Gave help."<br/><br/>"Needed help."<br/><br/>Then, back to everyone dancing, with one guy doing some crazy breakdancing move and the name "American Red Cross" over them, and the commercial ends.<br/><br/>Hmmm...<br/><br/>Long term, I don't know how well it will work, but the commercial is brilliant. It strips down the idea of the American Red Cross to its most basic element: people helping other people. More specifically, <em>individuals helping other individuals</em>. The American Red Cross is trying to dispel the notion in people's minds that their company is a large faceless organization into which people donate time and money, then a bunch of bureaucrats decide how to allocate said time and money, and somewhere after a bunch of processing, it goes to help other people.<br/><br/>Charity is not like a factory, and most people <em>know</em> that already, but the commercial is appealing to people with an emotional message, not facts or statistics. The message is simple and clear: if you choose to contribute to the Red Cross, than you <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> make a positive impact in someone else's life, even if you never witness the positive effect of your contribution directly.<br/><br/>It will probably only speak to those people that are predisposed to being charitable, but that's okay. It's powerful, it's memorable, and there's truth in it, so I think it will work. It seems effective because it's so positive, instead of a gloom-and-doom message about the terrible things in the world that need our attention. If they keep running the commercial, I think more people will sign up for their training, volunteer their time, and get involved in helping.

        One very cool innovation that I learned about in the last year: soft-close drawers for your kitchen and bathroom.<br/><br/>You pull open each drawer, same as you would any normal one, but when you go to close it, you just push it shut as hard as you like. When it gets about one and a half inches from being completely closed, a little hydraulic cylinder slows it down and then gently closes the drawer the rest of the way.<br/><br/>If that explanation seems a little esoteric, here's an 11-second video clip you can watch to get a sense of the idea:<br/><br/><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TrX9S9zih3I&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TrX9S9zih3I&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br/><br/>What makes this invention so interesting is that it solves a problem that you didn't even know existed until you see the solution. Most of us have little trouble closing an ordinary drawer, because we've been doing it our whole lives and it's a relatively simple operation. But somewhere, somebody noticed that closing drawers requires some effort. It's subtle, but with ordinary drawers, you do have to watch what you're doing when you're applying the pressure to close a drawer, and pull away at just the right instant when the drawer slides fully into the closed position. If you pull away too soon, the drawer isn't fully closed. Too late, and you might hurt your hand or wrist by putting extra strain on them pushing against an already closed drawer that won't budge. Even if you have drawers that coast smoothly closed, it's still possible to slam them if you just push once with too much pressure. <br/><br/>It actually solves all kinds of problems, of which you probably weren't aware. I certainly wasn't. Of course, once you see the solution, it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>In the annals of bumper sticker philosophy, there is a phrase about politics that goes: "If you're not angry, then you're not paying attention." (I get the point, but I'm less than convinced that getting angry is going to help us sort out our political problems.) So, I'd like to put a spin on this dumb little maxim and say the following, which is intended to serve both as my own New Year's Resolution and inspiration for others:<br/><br/><strong>If you're not innovating, then you're not paying attention.</strong><br/><br/>The soft close drawers got me thinking about the doors on cars. Why don't auto manufacturers create a soft-close door for driver and passenger doors? Make it so you can gently nudge a car door closed, it catches six inches away from being fully closed, and then shuts itself. Could it be the end of getting fingers slammed into doors? <br/><br/>The auto companies haven't come up with this yet because none of their customers has ever recognized the problem, because there really <em>isn't</em> a problem with car doors. They are the way they've always been, so no amount of customer focus groups are going to give you this idea.<br/><br/>Here's a more original idea: I noticed yesterday that my girlfriend, while driving, was removing both of her hands from the steering wheel briefly in order to blow her nose. Is it possible to develop a tissue that makes it easier, or more comfortable, to blow your nose with just one hand?<br/><br/>Human beings seem to thrive on complaining, and a lot of complaints belie really good ideas. You just have to become adept at listening to complaints in this fashion, even if they come from yourself. People are often dismissive of their own frustration or anger, but getting in that habit is bad for the inventor in all of us, because good ideas, when they come up, don't punch you in the face. They whisper into your ear and, as quickly as they came, disappear.

        In my mind, a person's intelligence has nothing to do with how many facts a person has jammed into their brain, how opinionated they are, or how strongly they cling to those opinions. <br/><br/>It has everything to do with how willing a person is, in light of new evidence or arguments, to consider new facts or opinions that conflict with their own.<br/><br/>You don't have to change your mind. But cognitive biases tend to reinforce prejudice against new ideas. Call it "changeism". If we stigmatize it with an "-ism" word, maybe people will be less inclined to think that way.

        Whenever you go to a shoe store and try on new pairs of shoes, there's one thing that people always do: try them on and walk around to see if they like how they feel. By the same token, there is always one thing missing from every shoe store that I've ever been do: a designated walking area. <br/><br/>The fitting room for a pair of shoes is not a closed and private area, like when people are trying on pants or tops. What they need is a small patch of ground that covers most terrains on which you plan to walk. Concrete. A patch of grass. An inclined surface. <br/><br/>I was with my girlfriend at a store earlier today called "Running Fit" that sold running accessories, one of which was shoes. Everyone in the place was trying on shoes and walking around the store amongst the racks of other, largely untouched merchandise to see how they liked the shoes. The whole time I was asking myself: Why isn't there a place to run?<br/><br/>If you're a shoe store selling high heels and you really want to be ostentatious, put in a runway. An elevated platform that women can stroll down, to make them feel glamorous. <br/><br/>The wisdom of Atticus Finch in <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> doesn't just apply to a man. You really don't know a pair of shoes until you put on those shoes and walk a mile in them.

      <div class="content">
        My girlfriend's mom had foot surgery a couple of years ago. Her doctor told her, "You should wear nothing but Merrell brand shoes whenever you can. There's nothing better you can put on your feet." So she has four pairs of Merrell shoes that she wears most of the time. She told me about them, and now, I own a pair of them. They're very comfortable for all of the hiking and the walking I do.<br/><br/>Earlier, she was talking about how uncomfortable her feet get when she has to wear dress shoes to meetings at work. I asked her if Merrell made dress shoes, so that her feet could be comfortable in spite of being in a stuffy office meeting. She told me that women's dress shoes always have a heel on them, which defeats the purpose of trying to create a shoe that properly supports the foot.<br/><br/>Heeled shoes are not good for women's feet, but they're fashionable. Manufacturers, in the interest of playing it safe, let fashion dictate what their product development department is creating. So, it's unlikely that Merrell is going to make a dress shoe, without a heel, that looks good enough for women to wear into the office.<br/><br/>It's a chicken and egg kind of problem.<br/><br/>The trick here is in changing the culture at large organizations that set dress codes for their employees. If Merrell wants to make a change in the way dress shoes are supposed to look, and break into a new market in the process, they should approach companies directly. Educate employers about how heeled shoes are not good for women's feet and, in the interest of the well-being of their employees, they should not only allow but encourage women to wear flat-soled dress shoes. Get podiatrists who feel passionately about the importance of good footwear to back you up.<br/><br/>Gradually, try and replace the culture that believes women should wear high-heeled shoes with the more pragmatic culture that takes into the account the health of women's feet. Once they've expended the energy to create this campaign, Merrell has the opportunity to generate awareness of a new line of comfortable, ergonomic dress shoes. If you're actually working to change things for the better, people are unlikely to mind that Merrell is being opportunistic.<br/><br/>The hard part is the culture change. Lots of companies still make heeled shoes for women. They're all going to fight you tooth and nail. They're going to work hard to keep fashion the way it is. But until the rules of fashion make more sense, I don't think we have any incentive to obey those rules. Quite the opposite, in fact.<br/><br/>The next time you see a woman in a business meeting wearing flat-soled shoes, pay her a compliment on them. Tell her how much you prefer the appearance of shoes that don't have heels. Give her kudos for challenging convention.
