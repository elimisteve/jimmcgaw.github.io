                      A German engineering company developed a spoon, to which even the most viscous liquids will not stick. You can dip it into honey, and they honey will roll right off without leaving a trace. The actual composition of the surface of the spoon is based on the properties of the leaves of the lotus flower. Even liquids like glue will roll right off the surface of the leaf.<br/><br/>Here's the company website, as well as a...

                      I spend a lot of time shopping and spending money on books on Amazon.com. They do an absolutely great job making product recommendations to me. I've actually spent more money because their cross-selling algorithm is so effective at determining what I want.<br/><br/>Contrast this with Borders. Borders made me get this annoying "Borders Rewards" card that they make me haul around on my keys to get discounts and coupons from them. As an individual, they know...

                      Last night, my girlfriend and I were hanging around in Borders, looking for a book that she was interested in reading. After having looked it up in their computer, we spent about ten minutes wandering around the section it was supposedly located in, trying to narrow down exactly where it was.<br/><br/>After a while, I started looking around for an employee to help us out, and I became aware of the black bubbles on the ceiling...

                      I've always thought that if you were in Marketing or Advertising, that every single show on network television would suddenly turn into the Super Bowl. Instead of muting the commercials or ignoring them, you'd pay attention because you'd be looking for inspiration or critique the commercials for their effectiveness. As of late, I've been studying marketing concepts, mostly because of my interest in the value of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing">Social Marketing</a>, so when the television is on...

                      One very cool innovation that I learned about in the last year: soft-close drawers for your kitchen and bathroom.<br/><br/>You pull open each drawer, same as you would any normal one, but when you go to close it, you just push it shut as hard as you like. When it gets about one and a half inches from being completely closed, a little hydraulic cylinder slows it down and then gently closes the drawer the rest...

                      In my mind, a person's intelligence has nothing to do with how many facts a person has jammed into their brain, how opinionated they are, or how strongly they cling to those opinions. <br/><br/>It has everything to do with how willing a person is, in light of new evidence or arguments, to consider new facts or opinions that conflict with their own.<br/><br/>You don't have to change your mind. But cognitive biases tend to reinforce prejudice...
