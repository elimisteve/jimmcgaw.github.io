                      While shopping for a new pair of shoes a few weeks ago, my girlfriend asked me a question I didn't expect: "Which of your feet is larger than the other?"I was caught off guard, simply because, as far as I could remember, no one has ever asked me that before. The first batch of questions back were, "Is that possible? Is that common? Do a lot of people have slight differences in the sizes of...

                      In one of their episodes of "Bullshit!", Penn and Teller question the effectiveness of anger management programs. In one study they presented during the episode, a psychologist divided students into two groups. Both groups were required to sit alone in a room and write a simple essay answer to a question. Their essay was taken out of the room and returned a short time later with a nasty review by a TA. One group was...

                      From reading the discussions that crop up on comment threads, you start to recognize that the most vocal commenters on the Internet are the literalists.Literalists are really good at finding the exceptions. For example, imagine that a recruiter posts an article on their blog saying there are times when you shouldn't practice too much for a job interview, because it will keep you on your toes and you might come across as more sincere.It's not...

                      I'd like to share a quick story: a few months ago, I wrote on here about musicians on the street. I suspected that they didn't need to wait to be discovered. The ones that really wanted to, I figured, would be able to get their hands on a computer, a mic, and some software that would let them start making music (no record company needed) and that MySpace pages were sufficient to give fans a...

                      At least once a week, I meet or have to deal with a person who, for whatever reason, doesn't respect me. Sometimes it comes across as blatant arrogance, and other times, it's more subtle, buried deep inside of a passing comment they make to me. I don't really mind this too much, because in social situations, I don't always act in a manner that demands respect. (It's the whole thing about reaping and sowing, I...

                      We all have lots of ideas, about things to do in at our jobs, personal projects we want to start, and life-changing plans. And we question ourselves, asking, "Is this a good idea? Am I sure this is a good idea?"A much better question: "Does anyone in my situation ever know for sure if they have a good idea or not?"If the answer to that question is no, then maybe the merits of the idea...

                      The world around us is not simply the way it is; it's the way we think it is. Reality is perception. It's the way we interpret it in our brains. Things are the way we think they are. Not a new concept, or even that insightful. But to this, it's worth adding: things have the potential to be what you think they can be. That's your opportunity.

                      This is a phrase indicative of a complete and total failure on the part of the marketing department that sent it. When a piece of junk mail lands in my mailbox and it's addressed to "James McGaw [or some former resident's name] or Current Resident", the message I get out of it is: "We don't know or care who you are, we don't really care who opens this envelope, and we're not even sure if...

                      When I was in middle school, I read a lot of fiction to pass the time. Most of it was the likes of Stephen King and other horror writers who wrote about fairly macabre things. And because I aspired to be a writer, I did everything I could to emulate their styles. The plots I devised were about weird and supernatural things happening to ordinary people in otherwise ordinary circumstances. I was writing for the...
