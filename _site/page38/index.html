        In one of their episodes of "Bullshit!", Penn and Teller question the effectiveness of anger management programs. In one study they presented during the episode, a psychologist divided students into two groups. Both groups were required to sit alone in a room and write a simple essay answer to a question. Their essay was taken out of the room and returned a short time later with a nasty review by a TA. One group was told to vent their anger at the TA by punching a pillow; the control group was instructed to sit in silence to contemplate their grade.<br /><br />After a while, a simple test was given to each student. They were told to fill in the missing letters in incomplete words, like this:<br /><br />a t t _ c _<br />c h o _ e<br />r _ p e<br />k i _ _<br /><br />The control group, which didn't do any venting, tended to fill in the blanks using letters that created innocuous words, like "attach" or "kind"; the group that did vent, however, used more violet words, like "attack" and "kill". The implication, of course, is that venting makes a person demonstrably more angry than not venting.<br /><br />The truth is that we live in a world filled with missing letters. Anger aside, all communication is imperfect, not only because of the use of imperfect mediums, but because of how we listen. There are gaps in what we hear, and we fill in those gaps using our mood, our world view, and our ideals. Our brains are not equipped to deal with blanks, so we've trained ourselves to fill them in.<br /><br />This isn't a problem. The problem is that are brains are really good at making us forget that we're even doing it.

        I don't usually get nostalgic, but here's a tool I use sometimes to see the way Internet sites were in the past:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a><br /><br />You can use it to see how Google's homepage has changed since they first launched 12 years ago (not much) or how Amazon's homepage has evolved (by leaps and bounds). An interesting repository. <br /><br />I think social media is lacking this in some places. I think it would be interesting to be able to see what people had posted on their Facebook pages in prior years on major holidays, like Thanksgiving or Christmas. (Would make a good addition to watching <em>A Christmas Story</em> on TBS 12 times in a row.)

        From reading the discussions that crop up on comment threads, you start to recognize that the most vocal commenters on the Internet are the literalists.<br /><br />Literalists are really good at finding the exceptions. For example, imagine that a recruiter posts an article on their blog saying there are times when you shouldn't practice too much for a job interview, because it will keep you on your toes and you might come across as more sincere.<br /><br />It's not the most controversial idea in history, but it's not a stretch to imagine people posting comments on this article about edge cases where this advice is a bad idea. "What if it's a technology company? What if it's a big company, like Google, and you really need to be prepared?" And so on. The literalists will come up with all the situations in which the recruiter's advice is bad and happily point those out. <br /><br />Usually these kinds of comments are friendly. Other times, they have the tone of "I found a single hole in your idea, so that means the whole idea is bunk!" It's a fairly common <em>non sequitur</em> on the Internet; it's usually a fallacy.<br /><br />Most of us who are reading advice on the Internet understand that any advice is implicitly prefaced with the words "In general..." We're dealing with guidelines, not hard-and-fast rules. In our minds, we absorb the spirit of what a person says, and we're retro-fitting the advice to our own situations where it's applicable.<br /><br />Quibbling over the letter of the law is a pretty good way of wasting time (unless you're an attorney.) Getting the spirit is a great way to learn and quickly move forward.

        I'd like to share a quick story: a few months ago, I wrote on here about musicians on the street. I suspected that they didn't need to wait to be discovered. The ones that really wanted to, I figured, would be able to get their hands on a computer, a mic, and some software that would let them start making music (no record company needed) and that MySpace pages were sufficient to give fans a starting point for finding them online.<br /><br />I decided to try and help, so I went out and bought a copy of ProTools and a microphone and hit the streets. I started asking the people that I saw playing guitar or bongos on the street if they wanted any help being recorded. I told them that I wasn't a professional audio engineer, but I had software and I wanted to learn how to use it better. The learning, I felt, would come best if I were on the hook to help someone (other than myself) try and capture their vision in sound. I was interested in doing it for free...charging for something that was effectively a commodity didn't make much sense to me.<br /><br />It's six months later and I haven't found any takers. A lot of the people I approached, to my surprise, reached down into the bags they carried with them and pulled out a MacBook. "I record on this," they would tell me, and go on to explain how they used the laptop's built-in microphone with GarageBand (the recording program that comes pre-installed on Macs) to create MP3s. Those that didn't have computers usually told me that they had a friend, or friend of a friend, who had a home studio and they would use that occasionally.<br /><br />Let me repeat that last part, in case you missed it: several people living <em>on the streets</em> have their own computers they carry with them, which they use to produce music. Maybe I'm a little late in arriving at this particular party, but I'm old enough to remember a time when this wasn't possible, so it still comes as a surprise to me. That fact that the tools needed to produce, to create, and to distribute are now in the hands of people who don't have a place to live. <br /><br />A lot of people realize this has gotten easier, but I don't think most people (myself included) really understand the severity of it. And I'm interested to see where that leads the state of music in the next ten to twenty years.

        At least once a week, I meet or have to deal with a person who, for whatever reason, doesn't respect me. Sometimes it comes across as blatant arrogance, and other times, it's more subtle, buried deep inside of a passing comment they make to me. I don't really mind this too much, because in social situations, I don't always act in a manner that demands respect. (It's the whole thing about reaping and sowing, I suppose.)<br /><br />But a more important thing to consider is this: while it would be easy for me to conclude that I catch people treating me with a lack of respect because I'm so perceptive, isn't it true that almost all of us can detect when someone we're talking to doesn't respect us? I think we all pick up on this kind of thing pretty easily, even if we're not aware of it, and even if it doesn't occur to us until much later, when we're no longer talking to that person.<br /><br />Thinking about this led me to a pretty important maxim: <em>don't deal at length with anyone you don't respect, because sooner or later, they're going to figure it out</em>. And when they realize it (it's a matter of when, not if), it's going to ruin the relationship. Even people who seem oblivious are relatively quick to pick up on the fact that someone they're talking to isn't treating them with respect.<br /><br />Granted, we can't all choose the company we keep all the time. We all have to work, and sometimes, in those situations, we have to deal with people that we don't respect. In these situations, my best advice: find a good reason to respect them and focus on that. Ignore the other stuff; put it out of your mind. Everyone has aspects of their personality that are respectable. Focus on those.<br /><br />If nothing else, it might make a bad job a little more bearable.

        We all have lots of ideas, about things to do in at our jobs, personal projects we want to start, and life-changing plans. And we question ourselves, asking, "Is this a good idea? Am I sure this is a good idea?"<br /><br />A much better question: "Does anyone in my situation ever know for sure if they have a good idea or not?"<br /><br />If the answer to that question is no, then maybe the merits of the idea don't matter so much. Maybe it's worth the risk of doing it.

        The world around us is not simply the way it is; it's the way we think it is. Reality is perception. It's the way we interpret it in our brains. Things are the way we think they are. <br /><br />Not a new concept, or even that insightful. But to this, it's worth adding: things have the potential to be what you think they can be. That's your opportunity.

        This is a phrase indicative of a complete and total failure on the part of the marketing department that sent it. When a piece of junk mail lands in my mailbox and it's addressed to "James McGaw [or some former resident's name] or Current Resident",  the message I get out of it is: "We don't know or care who you are, we don't really care who opens this envelope, and we're not even sure if you can benefit from what we're selling...but please, for our sake, we hope that <em>someone</em> will open and read this piece of junk."<br /><br />Can't direct mail marketers do any better than this?<br /><br />As an aside, I'm starting to believe that credit card companies that send out multitudes of offers to people are subsidized by several other industries...like paper producers, the post office, and companies that make paper shredders.

        When I was in middle school, I read a lot of fiction to pass the time. Most of it was the likes of Stephen King and other horror writers who wrote about fairly macabre things. And because I aspired to be a writer, I did everything I could to emulate their styles. The plots I devised were about weird and supernatural things happening to ordinary people in otherwise ordinary circumstances. I was writing for the horror genre, and my awareness of this fact drove me to develop the storyline and the characters in a certain way, that served that particular genre.<br /><br />A much better writer than me named Kurt Vonnegut used to write books, about stuff that mattered, and in a way that was very witty and insightful. Early on, people pegged him as a writer of science fiction. But he always insisted that he never set out to write science fiction, and anyone who's ever read one of his books knows that his books reach farther and wider than what typical science fiction offers.<br /><br />People have a much easy time with something that's labeled or categorized. It serves as a heuristic, so we quickly know how to judge it. Apparently we're more comfortable with things when we can stamp them with a stereotype.<br /><br />There are lots of good reasons for setting out to write for a particular genre; if you define your audience, then you know who to market to, and you know how to engage them, shock them, or delight them. But true innovation, and truly important and meaningful art, almost certainly happens when the artist is working without a particular category in mind.

        The Protestant Reformation happened because of Martin Luther's <em>Ninety-five Theses</em>. The widespread dissemination of this publication ultimately allowed this historical event to take place. And its mass production wouldn't have been possible without the recent invention of moveable type, which allowed lots of copies to be printed at once. And this invention did, unquestionably, change the course of history.<br /><br />Prior to moveable type, the only way to mass produce copies of a book was to have scribes sitting and copying books by hand. A little later, the printing press was creating, but each page of a book still had to be carved into a stone tablet. The difficulties of the production process kept publication out of the hands of an amateur. If you were going to take the trouble to print a book before, you'd better write something worth reading. <br /><br />Moveable type changed this. How did Martin Luther feel about the impacts of moveable type of society and culture? Even though the technology enabled him to do something (arguably) great, he recognized the double-edged sword; that is, as the means of production become more accessible to more people, the average quality of what they're producing inevitably goes down. He once said, "The multitude of books is a great evil. There is no measure of limit to this fever for writing; every one must be an author; some out of vanity, to acquire celebrity and raise up a name; others for the sake of mere gain."<br /><br />In the age of the Internet, does this kind of lamentation sound familiar to you?<br /><br />It's easy to bemoan the fall in average quality of what's produced, and it's natural to blame the sudden influx of lower quality on the medium itself. But is there a single person alive today who would still say that proliferation of books has been bad for civilization?
