        I saw a movie about five years ago called <em>Art School Confidential</em>. I thought it was a great flick, even though I have a particular distaste for those places where art meets academia.<br /><br />I have a friend who studied Art History in college who tells me that, based on his own experiences in art school, the film was very much true to life. It resonated with him, to some degree of accuracy. Despite this, the film itself is a work of fiction. Like most stories, it's someone else's fantasy. So, it can be dismissed with the catchall "That would never really happen."<br /><br />Someone recommended that I see a movie called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Exit_Through_the_Gift_Shop/70132200?trkid=2361637#height1434">Exit Through the Gift Shop</a> (Netflix link), which begins as a documentary film about street art. I believe that nothing ruins any piece of art like someone trying to verbally explain its meaning or significance, and that goes double for the artist who created it.<br /><br />Ergo, I'll leave it at this: it's a good film. Watch it.

        Here's a sign that was spotted hanging in the window of a Borders that's closing soon:<br /><br /><img style=" margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 159px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-503c2wkj6YA/TZlc7sjVjpI/AAAAAAAAAOs/dikhiR6zXgw/s200/borders_sign.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591602592998592146" /><br /><br />It's strange, because the public restrooms at Borders seemed to be a massive bone of contention over the past ten years. As the company started doing worse and worse, the employees seemed to put a squeeze on the bathrooms. Sometimes they were locked. Sometimes they were out of order for days at a time. Usually there were signs posted telling you not to use them unless you were a customer. (When does a patron become a customer?) And if they were open, you could count on them to be pretty disgusting. It wasn't quite like using them restrooms at a rock concert, but it wasn't far off, either.<br /><br />The experience of a Borders store was not often terrible, but that feeling always fell flat on its face as soon as you started dealing with the bathrooms. It was the clear the policy handed down from on high at Borders HQ was to try and keep the riff raff out of the bathroom, and when budget time came, it seemed like one of the first things to go. The reasoning for this is pretty obvious: they didn't want their stores to turn into public restrooms that happened to have a book section.<br /><br />Cutting the costs here seems easy enough, but for every homeless person or person that pops in off the street for no other reason than to use the john, there were probably ten other people who were just there to shop and needed to use the bathroom at some point. Trying to squeeze out the drive-by pissers by letting the bathrooms go to hell probably isn't going to work as a strategy, and at its worst, it annoys the best customers.<br /><br />If it had been me, the bathrooms probably would have been the first thing I would have changed as soon as Borders encountered rough economic waters. I'm always amazed how much money some companies spend on ads to make their retail store seem great, but the restrooms are atrocious. In these cases, I just consider myself lucky that I'm a male and that I have the option of the urinal.

        Two things you can do as a writer (that is, when you're not writing):<br /><br />1. Look for a publisher.<br /><br />2. Build an audience.<br /><br />Time was, you had to do the first one in order to do the second one. Nowadays, I think you should focus all your effort on #2. It's not easy, but if you pull it off, #1 will take care of itself.

        Here's one guiding principle I try to keep in mind every day: the true nature of a person's character doesn't lie in the merits of what they believe, but in how accepting they are of someone else who holds an opposing viewpoint.

        In the movie <em>Apollo 13</em>, based on the mission to the moon that took a turn for the worse, the astronauts were up in space with plenty of oxygen, but due to the damage to their vessel, they were left without sufficient filters to get rid of the carbon dioxide they were slowly exhaling into the air. On the ground, NASA engineers are tasked with solving the problem: create an air filter out of the limited supply of spare materials available to the crew in space.<br /><br />There's a great scene in the movie where someone dumps a bunch of boxes of random junk onto a table and says to everyone in the room (to paraphrase): "We have to solve this problem using nothing but that." To emphasize his point, he gestures to the pile of stuff on the table before them.<br /><br />The idea of doing this appeals to me. Most of us are constrained by certain things, usually by time or money, and while this hampers a lot of people, I'm always inspired by stories of people who started with very little, evaluating what they <em>did</em> have, and then putting it to good use.<br /><br />Clearly, given a million dollars, there's a lot of things that most of us could do. There's a lot of things that most of us want to do. Much more interesting to try and solve a problem given the means you have access to.

        Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that one attribute of good writing is that it lets you see the world through someone else's eyes. It lets you walk a mile in their circumstance and start to understand things as they understand them. <br /><br />This is the power of story. You can say things without saying them.<br /><br />In all this, there lies an opportunity for those who are teaching English classes. That's the lesson we can learn from books we're forced to read in high school: <em>empathy</em>. <br /><br />Much harder to teach, and much harder to evaluate with a standardized test, but I think it's far more important than focusing on themes, foreshadowing, and onomatopoeia.

        Do you know what a QR code is? They're the funny looking boxy UPC things. Here's one:<br /><br /><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 180px; height: 180px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9O2hZtYpiM/TZKpJGWQ2zI/AAAAAAAAAOk/BdDBLEWROhg/s320/jimmcgaw_qr_code.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5589716061308115762" />If you scan one of these with a smartphone barcode reader, it will read out the information. The one above contains a URL to a website, but they can contain just text or an image. They've been heralded as the next big thing for marketers, but in the United States, they haven't really caught on.<br /><br />There are a few reasons for this. First, it suffers from the same issues as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CueCat">CueCat</a>, in that it doesn't really solve a huge problem. They're mostly used for hyperlinks to product pages, so at most it saves a few keystrokes in a browser's address bar. And most people that I've met aren't even sure if they have a QR code reader on their phone.<br /><br />But one of the main reasons probably has to do with the fact that QR codes have largely been appropriated by marketers. The only places I've ever seen them is on promotional posters and in store windows. Television might be driven by advertising, but there are other aspects to the medium that make it a worthwhile invention. QR codes won't get picked up as a tool if they're used for little else than enabling companies to hock their wares.<br /><br />It would be interesting if someone did something a little more imaginative than try to sell something with it. Think of geocaching. What if someone constructed a puzzle of several pieces, made QR codes of each one, and hung them up in a single town around office buildings? Imagine passing an unlabeled, lonely QR code every day on your way into work? How long before your curiosity got the better of you and you tried scanning it?<br /><br />I think there are lots of interesting ways in which they could be used, none of which have anything to do with selling things.

        It seems that initiation is not so much about internally developing a vision of something over a long period of time, and then persuading people to think you're right.<br /><br />It's more like standing up and announcing to a sea of cubicles, "Hey, I'm going to get Middle Eastern food for lunch. Anyone else want to join me?"<br /><br />It's standing up, saying something, and seeing if anyone else follows you.<br /><br />(The analogy is even more realistic if you imagine that half of the people you're asking have already told you they hate Middle Eastern food.)

        Scareware is software that is installed onto a user's computer and makes the user think that they've been infiltrated by a computer virus or a worm. At the same time, it offers the user the chance to clean their computer by purchasing a computer program that will scan the hard drive and remove all threats. The threat is fake, but it can seem real enough to get people to put in their credit card numbers and purchase the "solution". In these cases, the creator of the malicious software manages to make a quick buck from a frightened end user.<br /><br />In one case, the creators of the scareware had infected and collected money from over 1 million people, all of whom payed $40 for the solution. In December of 2008, the FTC brought charges against the company in the amount of $8 million dollars, which was set aside to go to the victims who were duped out of their money.<br /><br />I'm not a super savvy business person, but doing something that brings in $40 million and only costs you $8 million seems like an awfully high profit margin, even for a software product. I'm not sure the FTC is going to be putting a stop to these kinds of shenanigans by issuing what seems like little more than a financial slap on the wrist.

        Director David Fincher gave a talk a couple of years ago that I attended, in which he shared a story about the release of his film <em>Se7en</em>. As a promotional tactic, the production company did a screening of the film shortly before its release. It wasn't widely publicized, but a poster was placed outside to drawn in people to watch the film. According to Fincher, the poster said something like this:<br /><br />"Do you want to see Morgan Freeman (<em>Driving Miss Daisy</em>) and Brad Pitt (<em>Legends of the Fall</em>) in a new movie?"<br /><br />If you've seen these three films, or at least familiar with their style, you understand that this poster was a terrible mismatch in terms of bringing in an audience. Needless to say, reactions to the film at this screening were incredibly poor. Fincher concluded his talk by saying that he felt it was important for an audience to have a rough idea of what they're getting themselves into before they go to see a film.<br /><br />He's right, but at the same time, all of the movies, television shows, and music that has wowed me has been something akin to what I was expecting, but it blows my expectations out of the water. Early on, people told me to watch "Lost", and offered me a vague description of its premise. The summary was enough to pique my curiosity, but the show itself definitely surpassed any expectations I had before I started watching.<br /><br />I think there's a lesson here, and it lies in setting up people's expectations, and then both simultaneously meeting and confounding them at the same time. Giving people exactly what you told them to expect is probably not enough to thrill them.
