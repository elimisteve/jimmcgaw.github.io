                      I saw a movie about five years ago called Art School Confidential. I thought it was a great flick, even though I have a particular distaste for those places where art meets academia.I have a friend who studied Art History in college who tells me that, based on his own experiences in art school, the film was very much true to life. It resonated with him, to some degree of accuracy. Despite this, the film...

                      Here's a sign that was spotted hanging in the window of a Borders that's closing soon:It's strange, because the public restrooms at Borders seemed to be a massive bone of contention over the past ten years. As the company started doing worse and worse, the employees seemed to put a squeeze on the bathrooms. Sometimes they were locked. Sometimes they were out of order for days at a time. Usually there were signs posted telling...

                      Two things you can do as a writer (that is, when you're not writing):1. Look for a publisher.2. Build an audience.Time was, you had to do the first one in order to do the second one. Nowadays, I think you should focus all your effort on #2. It's not easy, but if you pull it off, #1 will take care of itself.

                      Here's one guiding principle I try to keep in mind every day: the true nature of a person's character doesn't lie in the merits of what they believe, but in how accepting they are of someone else who holds an opposing viewpoint.

                      In the movie Apollo 13, based on the mission to the moon that took a turn for the worse, the astronauts were up in space with plenty of oxygen, but due to the damage to their vessel, they were left without sufficient filters to get rid of the carbon dioxide they were slowly exhaling into the air. On the ground, NASA engineers are tasked with solving the problem: create an air filter out of the...

                      Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that one attribute of good writing is that it lets you see the world through someone else's eyes. It lets you walk a mile in their circumstance and start to understand things as they understand them. This is the power of story. You can say things without saying them.In all this, there lies an opportunity for those who are teaching English classes. That's the lesson we can learn from books we're...

The one above contains a URL to a website, but they can contain just text or an image. They've been heralded as the next big thing for marketers, but in the United States, they haven't really caught on.There are a few reasons...

                      It seems that initiation is not so much about internally developing a vision of something over a long period of time, and then persuading people to think you're right.It's more like standing up and announcing to a sea of cubicles, "Hey, I'm going to get Middle Eastern food for lunch.

                      Scareware is software that is installed onto a user's computer and makes the user think that they've been infiltrated by a computer virus or a worm.
