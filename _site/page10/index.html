                      Bottled water, as an idea and as a reality, is ridiculous. I know this. So does everyone else.And yet, there are several empty and full plastic bottles of water in my home and the place where I work.There is a lot of controversy surrounding the bottled water industry, which seems to be insanely profitable despite the fact that they're packaging something that any of us could get for free. So where's the value added? Why...

                      Make no mistake: validation is what almost everyone is looking for with almost every action they take.If someone shares an opinion with you, more likely than not, they're looking for confirmation that you agree with them. Or that you think they're smart. Or, at the very least, they're asking you to hear them out and acknowledge that you've at least considered their point of view.You can read any number of "How to Make Other People...

                      The name "Trivial Pursuit" was likely coined to be tongue-in-cheek. No doubt they were playing to the fact that "trivial" contains the word "trivia", but someone at Hasbro must have intended the self-deprecating connotation. Namely, that pursuing victory in a board game with random trivia questions isn't an achievement with any real substance.In an era when most of us have a computer in our pocket, capable of looking up the answers to any of these...

                      The origins of management hierarchy in large organizations probably have their roots in ego. At some point, someone pointed at someone else and said, "He needs a manager. He needs to be controlled, kept in line, instructed...and I'm just the guy to do it!"That's not to decry organizational hierarchy. To say it's born of self-importance, whether reasonable or not, is only to say it's quintessentially human.These hierarchies, while they have some major drawbacks, exist for...

                      Your best years are ahead of you.I may not know you, or have a clue how old you are, but I know I'm right. Yesterday, the day before, and the expanse of days that stretch into the past belong to the ages. Mourn them if you must, but they are history's property now.But today? And tomorrow? Those belong to you.

                      Sometimes, when a work of art achieves commercial success, it is described, after the fact, as an "unlikely success".You can only refer to something as unlikely based on some prior expectation. It was unlikely to be successful because someone deemed that to be the most probable outcome. The person who deemed it to be unlikely, and their reasons for doing so, are supremely important.Maybe the film didn't have the budget of a major studio, so...

                      There are certain types of debates in which I don't get involved. Generally, this is when a line is drawn and two opposing sides start lobbing stones at one another. This is a pretty good summary of why I keep my distance:"Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm...When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger."No, this doesn't surprise me, because everyone (including myself)...

                      Simple question: if there were a proposed change to be made in this country that would arguably leave everyone better off in some important way, but it put you out of a job, would you fight the change?I use the word "arguably" very deliberately, because I learned very quickly as an adult that 1. almost everything is arguable, and 2. if it's arguable, it will be argued.

                      Yes, it's true. There are tons of people out there who are characterized by vapid, mindless optimism.Yes, they are annoying. They are a turn-off. They don't actually accomplish much.But it's a massive mistake to correlate their optimism with their vacuous mindsets. Negativity also has the capacity to be mindless. And it my experience, it often is.Don't be overly negative in an attempt to appear smart. Usually, it has the opposite effect. And it makes you...
