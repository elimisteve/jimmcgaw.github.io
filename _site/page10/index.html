Have you ever tilted a bottle with a tiny mouth over a traditional drinking fountain and attempted to fill it from that tiny stream with an arc of three inches? It's hard to do. There should be a separate spout on the side of all drinking fountains that allow you to fill a bottle without doing that inconvenient dance.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; "><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; ">I'd like to drink tap water, make it known without having to explicitly tell people, and not have to appear pious in the process. Deciding to forgo bottled water in favor of tap water is an invisible activity, and the only way to make it known is by telling other people that you're doing it.

        The name "Trivial Pursuit" was likely coined to be tongue-in-cheek. No doubt they were playing to the fact that "trivial" contains the word "trivia", but someone at Hasbro must have intended the self-deprecating connotation. Namely, that pursuing victory in a board game with random trivia questions isn't an achievement with any real substance.<div><br /></div><div>In an era when most of us have a computer in our pocket, capable of looking up the answers to any of these questions, what is the point of this game? Sure, the one thing that keeps us from cheating is the fact that we're playing with friends or family.

"Where's the fun in that?" they'd ask.</div><div><br /></div><div>If someone asked me to play Trivial Pursuit, that's the question I'd ask them.

        Here's an old Gallup Poll I came across today which asks of people: <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114544/darwin-birthday-believe-evolution.aspx">Do you believe in the theory of evolution?</a><br /><br />First off, here's the exact question that was posed to those polled:<br /><br />"Do you, personally, believe in the theory of evolution, do you not believe in evolution, or don't you have an opinion either way?"<br /><br />So, we're not talking about evolution vs. Creationism here. That's a different discussion that has no bearing on the point I'm about to make.<br /><br />The chart that interests me is the second one, labeled "Belief in Evolution, by Education Level." It's clear from the chart that as you move from one level of "highest education attained" to the next, the proportion of people that believe in evolution increases, but that's not what interests me here.<br /><br />What interests is at the left of the chart: of those sampled, 52% people with an education level of "High school or less" said they had no opinion about the theory of evolution. That means that half the people who were asked about a rather complicated topic chose to say, "I don't know."<br /><br />You could point to this as an indicator of a few things. As one example, maybe high schools are failing to teach our kids about the theory of evolution to the point where they feel they can have an opinion about it. And maybe you'd be right. But what amazes me is that the people sampled here were smart enough to <em>know that they didn't know</em>.<br /><br />I have trouble buying that someone who says "I don't know" when asked a question is stupid. If that's the honest answer, then it's a smart move.<br /><br />Of the postgraduate students polled, a full 74% said they believed in the theory of evolution. The important question: of them, how many studied evolutionary biology in their years of higher education? How many of them could defend the theory of evolution and back it up with evidence? How many of them know anything about the theory of evolution beyond its existence in the scientific community?<br /><br />I'm a "College Graduate" in the classification the graph offers. But I never actively studied biology, and to the extent I was forced to in order to fulfill academic requirements, I didn't really pay much attention. I have friends with strong opinions about this one way or the other, and while I'm familiar with their thoughts, they're not substantial enough to base my own opinion on them.<div><br /></div><div>Am I hesitant? You bet. Hesitation is underrated.</div>

        The origins of management hierarchy in large organizations probably have their roots in ego. At some point, someone pointed at someone else and said, "He needs a manager. He needs to be controlled, kept in line, instructed...and I'm just the guy to do it!"<br /><br />That's not to decry organizational hierarchy. To say it's born of self-importance, whether reasonable or not, is only to say it's quintessentially human.<br /><br />These hierarchies, while they have some major drawbacks, exist for a few reasons. Since they originated in the military, there's obviously a chain-of-command that's in place by design. Orders come from on high, and trickle down the layers of people to those at the bottom where, eventually, someone actually does some work.<br /><br />It's not clear whether a company producing consumer goods or software necessarily needs a chain-of-command. In these situations, my guess is that hierarchy exists to control the flow of information. Tasks requiring groups of people to accomplish them are allocated to silos of people, and information flows from top to bottom, and vice versa. This keeps everyone in the loop. (At least, in theory.)<br /><br />I do wonder if this could be superseded. As a society that's become permeated by the Internet, we're moving away from more traditional social systems to sociotechnical systems. As is characteristic of all computerized social systems, interactions produce a substantial, and ever-persisted, trail of data. This is usually perceived as a threat to privacy, so it seems like a drawback.<br /><br />If everyone in your company is communicating with each other using a private social network to interact with someone, then all you need to do to stay in the loop is keep up on reading a news feed. <br /><br />Of course, I'm oversimplifying. In any company of substantial size, some things will need to be made private. Some people need to be in charge of an organization, to make the tough decisions that would make everyone else in the company uncomfortable. Cutting spending on the company health benefits for employees, for example, will likely always happen behind closed doors.<br /><br />But have any smaller companies experimented with computerized systems to let teams of people coordinate amongst themselves? Or to have departments coordinate between each other?

Maybe some successes are actually unlikely when compared to some arbitrary standard set forth by a critic.</div><div><br /></div><div>I remain cynical. I think it takes guts to create the unlikely. And now, more than ever, markets are willing to make the unlikely a success.</div>

        There are certain types of debates in which I don't get involved. Generally, this is when a line is drawn and two opposing sides start lobbing stones at one another. <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/">This is a pretty good summary</a> of why I keep my distance:<div><br /></div><div>"Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm...When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger."</div><div><br /></div><div>No, this doesn't surprise me, because everyone (including myself) is susceptible to this kind of behavior. These days, I'm much less inclined to treat a person who's expressing a dissenting opinion to me as a personal attack.</div>

        Simple question: if there were a proposed change to be made in this country that would arguably leave everyone better off in some important way, but it put you out of a job, would you fight the change?<br /><br />I use the word "arguably" very deliberately, because I learned very quickly as an adult that 1. almost everything is arguable, and 2. if it's arguable, it will be argued.

        Yes, it's true. There are tons of people out there who are characterized by vapid, mindless optimism.<br /><br />Yes, they are annoying. They are a turn-off. They don't actually accomplish much.<br /><br />But it's a massive mistake to correlate their optimism with their vacuous mindsets. Negativity also has the capacity to be mindless. And it my experience, it often is.<br /><br />Don't be overly negative in an attempt to appear smart. Usually, it has the opposite effect. And it makes you miserable in the process.
