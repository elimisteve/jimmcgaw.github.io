        Usually, when we use the phrase "Don't shoot the messenger", we do it in the interest of pointing out that the bearer of bad news isn't in any way responsible for the bad news itself. <br/><br/>But there's another reason that a lot of us shoot the messenger, and it has nothing to do with the news itself. When someone presents us with an idea, we assess the idea and ultimately reach a decision that is tainted with our own perception of the messenger himself. We frame what people tell us with our own opinion of those people, and that leads to our conclusion.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if Suze Orman, Jim Cramer, and Charles Schwab give you exactly the same financial advice in exactly the same words. If you like one of them but not the other two, you'll only listen to the advice coming from the one you like, based on your own personal preference and comfort level. Or maybe you hate all three of those people I mentioned because you think they're all profiteering scammers, but if a family member gave you the same advice, you'd listen to the family member and write off the advice of the other three.<br/><br/>Who the messenger is (to us) matters a great deal.<br/><br/>From this, you could draw that if you want to influence those around you, you need to be careful to frame yourself in the eyes of others, and how other people perceive you. I think the real lesson is that we need to listen carefully no matter who is talking. Great ideas and advice are everywhere, and they're generally free. Ignoring them because you don't like the messenger is shooting <em>yourself</em> in the foot.

        If I had to describe myself very simply at this point in my life, I'd call myself a "recovering fatalist". I think this is the plight of a lot of people in their mid- to late-twenties. <br/><br/>I spent most of my youth believing that we're all pretty much screwed no matter what we do in life. I still think that a lot of what happens to us is mostly attributable to luck and circumstance, but I'm trying to convince myself that a positive attitude and lots of effort isn't an exercise in futility, and to live that mentality each day. <br/><br/>Trying greatly increases your odds of failing, but it also increases your odds of succeeding.

        You have something that other people would buy from you.<br/><br/>I'm sure of it. I don't know what it is, because I can't be sure who you are and I may not know you personally. But I think everyone has something, whether it's an idea, art, or skill, that others want and would gladly pay you for. <br/><br/>Maybe it's not for everyone. Maybe it's only five people, or five hundred, or five thousand who are willing to pay for what you've got. But rest assured, they're out there.<br/><br/>The challenge doesn't lie in coming up with an idea and producing something great from it. The challenge lies in reaching those five people for the first time so that they know who you are. It's in the production of those first five units. It's in shipping those five units to people.<br/><br/>Do you have a book to publish and sell to people? Time was, you needed to convince a major publisher that your book was worthwhile enough to print several hundred copies and spend the money to distribute it. Now, you can go on <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">lulu.com</a> and self-publish with a far lower initial investment. You get an ISBN, they print copies as they are ordered, and help with distribution on Amazon.com. More importantly, you keep most of the profits.<br/><br/>Big ideas are more attractive because they seem more cost effective. Traditionally, finding those first five people was an expensive process, and you probably couldn't make a lot of money producing something for only five people. That's still true, but with the Internet, finding those five people just got easier.<br/><br/>And you never know until you try. It might be more than five. It may be five thousand people. Or even five <em>hundred</em> thousand.<br/><br/>So, let me ask you: what do you have to sell me?

        The bill banning cigarette smoking in bars and restaurants in the state of Michigan passed in December of 2009, and is set to go into effect in May of the following year. Interestingly enough, there are a few restaurants that never allowed smoking inside, even before it was banned. One of them is Red Hawk.<br/><br/>Red Hawk is located in downtown Ann Arbor, right in the heart of the University of Michigan's campus. They opened up 15 years ago, and from day one, they never permitted smoking inside the restaurant. If you're dining or drinking there and feel the urge to light up, you have to take it outside.<br/><br/>I'm astonished by how few other restaurants chose to take this approach. Most other restauranteurs, when trying to determine their smoking policy, probably thought, "If we don't allow smoking, then smokers will be less inclined to eat there." Because smokers are such a large portion of the population on a college campus, it was probably a scary prospect to cut them out of potential customers.<br/><br/>The other side to this, of course, is that if you accomodate smokers, than you run the risk of alienating the portion of restaurant-goers that hate the smell of cigarette smoke. People have never fallen into only the two categories of "smoking" and "non-smoking". There's a third group: "non-smoking and refuses to tolerate proximity to smoking".<br/><br/>Red Hawk recognized the value in catering to this last group. Their food is not that expensive (and it's very good), but for the last fifteen years, they could have charged a premium for their food just for offering clients the experience of being able to eat without having to breathe second-hand smoke.<br/><br/>Maybe Red Hawk didn't do it for this reason. They might have just been thinking that, from a health perspective, that it was the right thing to do for their patrons and the best way of leading other restaurants by example. Maybe they did it so they could have their choice of servers in Ann Arbor who were smart and didn't smoke, and also wanted to work in an environment where they wouldn't be subjected to second-hand smoke. <br/><br/>Whatever the reason, it's crazy that more restaurants didn't dare to differentiate themselves by being smoke-free. I hope that their loyal following of patrons keep going their even after the rest of the restaurants are smokeless. They probably will; even in the wake of abolished smoking, most other restaurants will continue to reek of smoke for years to come.<br/><br/>It took guts for them to get it right the first time.

      <div class="content">
        A few years ago, I saw a "America's Most Wanted" type of investigative show that details real-life crime occurrences. The episode I watched told the tragic story of a father who was looking for his daughter's killer. The police had a rough sketch taken from witnesses' descriptions of the suspect to go on, but little else in the way of leads.<br/><br/>One day, the father has a flash of insight as he's driving down the highway: put the police sketch up on billboard and see if anyone can identify the suspect. Give them a number to call so they can give the name and details of the suspect to the police.<br/><br/>The happy news is: this worked. It lead to the arrest and conviction of the killer. Someone saw the billboard, read about the details of the crime, and called it in. <br/><br/>Using a billboard this way was brilliant not because it forced lots of more people to look at the police sketch; it worked because no one had ever done that before. Since then, there have been a few police departments who use the same strategy to give a sketch of suspect high visibility. But the problem is, if all police departments start doing this, and billboards everywhere fill up with police sketches, people would start tuning them out. They become the faces of missing children on milk cartons and cards in the mail that ask "Have you seen me?"<br/><br/>Women started posting the color and size of their bras as Facebook statuses as a way of raising awareness of breast cancer. It was cryptic, but it made people curious and inquisitive ("Why is everyone posting colors? Did I miss something???"), so I think it worked much better than a simple status mention of the disease. But rest assured that lots of other non-profits across the country took note, and a few of them are likely plotting a similar viral campaign as we speak. Namely: ask people to post something as a status in social media that doesn't make sense on its own, and it will force other people to figure out what they're talking about.<br/><br/>It's a little different than the billboards, in two ways. First, it will be less effective because it's already been done in that fashion. Second, in order to be executed, people have to agree to it. They have to agree to use their statuses for you. And because most people already know the first part, they're less likely to go along with any future campaign that's been cooked up to generate awareness in this fashion.

      <h1><a href="/2010/01/14/strength-of-weak-ties.html">Strength of Weak Ties</a></h1>
      <p class="post-meta">

      <div class="content">
        For several years now, sociologists and social psychologists have been well-aware of the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties">the strength of weak ties</a>, which basically says that weak connections between individuals are often more important than strong ones. For example, you're more likely to find a job opportunity from an acquaintance than a close friend.<br/><br/>While this holds true for interpersonal connections amongst individuals, I think there's an opportunity here for companies as well. I recently wrote and published a computer book with one of the larger publishers in the industry, and the experience with them was, at best, so-so. Their process for creating books is very mechanical, and while I would love to offer my suggestions to them, they never gave me the impression that anyone working for the company cares or would even listen to anything I suggested. The few questions and suggestions I offered were pretty much ignored. Consequently, I kept my head down and my mouth shut, and I'm okay with that.<br/><br/>But consider this: last night I was sitting with a friend at a coffee shop, and he was reading my book. At some point, he looked up and said, "You know, the lines of text on the page are really close together. It would help the readability of the words if they added more space between each line."<br/><br/>Here, we have a person who reads lots of computer books, and he finds the format that my publisher chose to use in printing the text a little difficult to read. How many other readers have felt the same way about how "scrunched" the lines of text are? It's extremely difficult for them to know, because getting feedback from readers about that kind of thing is a very difficult thing to do.<br/><br/>Even if they create a "Submit feedback" link on the homepage of their site, how many readers are going to think enough of a small suggestion for improvement that they'll take the time to register their complaint? For something that small, it hardly seems worth the time. And even if they did, it's unlikely that anyone at the publishing company is taking the time to review and seriously consider the small suggestions.<br/><br/>Yet small suggestions are what they need. They are what every company needs for continuous improvement. But it's very challenging to get that kind of "small" feedback from people. If the publisher I worked for had bothered to listen to my suggestions as an author, and encouraged my feedback, I would have gladly told them my friend's suggestion for line spacing in the text, which could benefit all of the readers of all of their books. That is such a wasted opportunity on their part.<br/><br/>Consider the company you work for: are there any "weak ties" lurking in your relationships that could provide you with valuable insight?

        A few years ago, I was looking at books on No Limit Hold 'em in the poker section of Borders. I picked up a rather advanced one that was written by David Sklansky and Ed Miller, who are very smart cookies when it comes to poker writing and are more than happy to throw their knowledge of more advanced mathematical concepts, as they apply to poker, into your face.<br/><br/>As I stood there thumbing through the pages of the book, I noticed an older gentleman with a beard standing next to me out of the corner of my eye. He was looking down at the book in my hands and then back up at me, back and forth, and I could tell he was just itching to say something to me. He was just waiting for me to give him the opportunity to speak up.<br/><br/>Knowing that there was no easy way to get out of the situation, I glanced over at him. (I didn't think to fake getting a cell phone call until an hour later.)<br/><br/>"That's not a beginner's book," he told me rapidly, his eyes large and bulging. I could now see that he was dressed like either a homeless person or a professor of philosophy at a community college.<br/><br/>"Oh, I know," I said politely.<br/><br/>"You'll be confused by that, it's very advanced," he continued, clearly not having heard me. "You should start by reading <em>The Theory of Poker</em>, and then tackle Dan Harrington's books."<br/><br/>"Actually, I've read those," I told him. "I thought Harrington's books were really helpful, even though I play in home games and not tournaments."<br/><br/>He was visibly bothered by this response, and didn't seem to know what to say to me after that. If I remember correctly, after a long beat, he restated the book I was holding wasn't for beginners and mumbled a few other things.<br/><br/>There really wasn't anything I could have said to make him comfortable. After studying me for a few seconds, he already had his first impression of me worked out in his head. Apparently I looked like a real Hold 'em greenhorn (which, to his credit, I actually am, despite having read the books he'd mentioned) and he based his interaction with me on that impression. And when reality seemed to conflict with that impression, it clearly made him uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, first impressions can't be made by appearances alone. I've often made remarks to people upon first meeting them, just based on the way they look, and been dead wrong. They say something that makes me realize I was mistaken, and I have to quickly alter the impression in my mind before it solidifies. <br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with jumping to conclusions as long as you remain adaptable, and retain the ability to admit, at least to yourself, that you might have been wrong.

        I realize that the American Dairy Association (is that what they're called? I'm not going to look it up) probably doesn't want to jump on the bandwagon of the latest "energy drink" craze, by if they want kids to start drinking milk to get calcium and healthy bones and whatever, why don't they create a version of milk that has caffeine in it?<br/><br/>Call it "PowerMilk" and sell it in vending machines in high schools across the country. Make it more convenient than the little boxes you can buy in cafeterias. That's why I drank lots of soda pop when I was in high school: it was far more convenient to stick a dollar in a machine than to stand in line waiting to deal with those grumpy ladies who worked in the cafeteria.<br/><br/>It's similar to taking advice from Mary Poppins about a spoonful of sugar. If a small dose of caffeine helps the milk go down, then why not put it into milk to encourage kids to drink more of it?

        When I was in college, I lived with a large group of people. Among them, there was a girl who had a bag of Marshmallow Peeps around Easter. Someone found the box sitting open and unwrapped in a cupboard, and they asked her about it. Aren't these going to go bad?<br/><br/>"I'm 'staling' them," she replied with a smile.<br/><br/>She wasn't the first person to have this revelation. I remember discovering at a very young age how much more satisfying it is to eat stale Peeps marshmallows. And I've met several people since who use them that way. You leave them open and exposed to the air for a few days, and then you've got good, tough Peeps to eat. Kind of like beef jerky, only sweeter.<br/><br/>Now I wonder: why haven't they tried selling Peeps marshmallows that come 'pre-staled', packaged and ready to eat for your convenience?<br/><br/>[update] My mom suggested this be called "Peep Jerky". (Now that's good branding.)

        People often try and conclude debates (particularly those online) by making grand statements about how the world is going to come to an end. For example:<br/><br/>"If we lose our newspapers, it's going to be undoing of our civilization and we're all going to be sorry."<br/><br/>This is an appealing way to try and get people's attention, because we've all been taught that the best way to get people to listen to you (and agree with you) is to yell at them. The louder, the better. If that doesn't work, then try saying something grandiose that will get their attention...like mentioning the undoing of our civilization.<br/><br/>The problem is: most things aren't that dramatic. People like to point to the fall of Rome as evidence of the hubris of man and that all governments, no matter how good they are, are ephemeral. Unfortunately, even knowing exactly what caused the fall of Rome is still a matter of debate among historians. They all have their theories and attribute it to many different causes, some working together.

Getting people to listen to you with a bang doesn't typically work, either.
